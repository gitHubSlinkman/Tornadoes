During the day, very strong warm air advection took place.  Temperatures warmed rapidly  during the day with highs reaching the mid to upper 90s over about the southwest half of the state.  Dew point temperatures were in the upper 60s to low 70s.  This combination produced CAPE values in excess of 8000 J/kg.  During the afternoon, a strong cap was in place with 700 mb temperatures around +16 C.  This prevented convection from firing during the afternoon.  Toward evening, thunderstorms broke through the cap over northeast Iowa.  The storms went from initial echo to tornadic storms in less than 50 minutes.  A supercell formed west of the Waterloo area.  This cell became a splitting cell and produced a brief tornado in Grundy County as the right moving cell split off, and golf ball size hail in Bremer County from the left moving cell.  The cell moved off quickly, however additional supercells back developed over the same area.  the strongest tornado developed in the Cedar Falls area and tracked across the northern portions of Waterloo.  This cell produced a strong tornado which was actually a multi-vortex tornado based on reports from storm chasers in the area.  At one point, west of Dunkerton, three tornadoes each one quarter mile wide were on the ground with this storm.  The tornado damaged several houses and a few farmsteads along the way.  Reports indicated between 5 and 10 houses in Black Hawk County were totally destroyed, and another 15 to 20 sustained significant damage.  A total of at least 41 structures sustained at least some damage.  In addition to the tornado, damage also occurred south of the track as RFD winds estimated as high as 100 MPH were observed.  Dunkerton was hard hit as the tornado moved through.  Heavy damage was reported at a coop elevator in Dunkerton, with 10 of 16 grain elevators damaged.  A roof was removed from a church as well, resulting in about $500,000 damage.  The City Hall building was destroyed in Dunkerton.  The City Hall was housed in a series of double wide trailers since ironically the former City Hall building was destroyed just last year in the floods of '99.  As the tornado moved through the fairly densely populated area, numerous injuries were reported.  Some of the injuries were severe with limbs being cut off by flying debris.

The storm produced a prolific path of large hail, a brief tornado, and a significant wet microburst across central and east central Wisconsin.  The storm was one of the most damaging thunderstorms in Wisconsin history, producing well over $100 million in damage.

The thunderstorm developed north of a warm front, which was located across the Wisconsin/Illinois border.  The setup was favorable for what is known as "elevated" convection; that is, the source of the instability was aloft, and not surface-based.  Elevated convection often produces large hail, and the May 12 storm was no exception.

As the storm moved into central Wisconsin, numerous reports of large hail were received from Waushara and Winnebago counties.  Baseball size hail was observed with the storm in Waushara county, two miles east of Coloma and in Dakota.  Hail damaged many of the roofs of the more than 1,000 homes in Omro (Winnebago co.) alone.

As the storm intensified, it produced extensive damage across Calumet and Manitowoc counties as microburst winds developed.  Wind-driven hail shredded west-facing sides of homes and businesses that were caught in the path of the storm.

The worst damage in Calumet county was in and around Chilton, where 2 inch hail and hurricane-force wind gusts (estimated near 80 mph) knocked holes in siding and tore the walls and roofs from some buildings.  Over 1000 homes were damaged in the city of Chilton.  Two hundred more sustained damage in the township of Charlestown.

A brief tornado occurred as the storm entered Manitowoc county, but did no damage.  At about 1150 a.m. CDT, microburst winds near 100 mph and 2 inch hail combined to produce very serious damage in St. Nazianz.  Most of the homes in a mobile home park in St. Nazianz were overturned or knocked off their foundation by the straight-line wind.

Thunderstorms quickly erupted along the boundary from Central Iowa through Northeast Iowa into Northern Illinois by late morning, and continued through the afternoon producing a few reports of large hail and torrential rain.  Further south, a few supercells developed near Ottumwa.  These supercells moved east into Washington...Jefferson and Iowa Counties producing large hail, high winds and a couple of brief, weak tornadoes in Iowa County.  An F0 tornado touched down 3 miles northwest of Millersburg while another touched down several minutes later just west of North English.  Both tornadoes were short lived and produced no damage.  All auto dealerships in the city of Washington reported that nearly every car on their outside lots was damaged by the hail, which was as large as golfballs.  Many homes suffered hail damage to siding, roofs and windows.  The hail covered the ground in spots and was reported to have drifted as high as a foot up against the sides of some buildings in town.  Damage to corn crops was minimal, while soybean crops were not as lucky, as many suffered extensive damage.  Many acres had to be replanted.  High winds were responsible for blowing a house trailer onto it's side while being transported north of Washington on Riverside Road.  The supercell over Jefferson County weakened, while the Washington County supercell tracked northeast into Muscatine County producing golfball size hail, torrential rain, high winds and a few funnel clouds.  Hail damaged several cars in Muscatine.  High winds caved the roof in on a barn 6 miles west of Muscatine and scattered pieces of the wood structure across the farmland.  The supercell then gradually weakened as it moved into the Quad Cities, but still managed to produce penny to golfball sized hail and high winds in Central and Western Scott County.

At the same time, very strong winds aloft moved over the area. The combination of the instability, and lift ahead of the front, spawned a line of thunderstorms. These storm tapped into the strong wind aloft, to produce the largest outbreak of severe weather across eastern New York in nearly two years. While the vast majority of damage was from thunderstorm winds, there was also some hail damage reported, along with two confirmed tornadoes. It was the first time since June 1998 that a tornado was officially confirmed in eastern New York. 
	Thunderstorm winds knocked down large trees a powerlines at several locations in Albany, Columbia, Greene, Montgomery, Saratoga, Schoharie and Ulster counties. Dutchess county was especially hard hit. 
	A line of strong to locally severe thunderstorms first moved into Montgomery County during the mid afternoon. Strong winds blew down large trees in Fort Plain. Then a microburst produced a swath of damage, 8 miles long, from west to east in the town of Canajoharie. The swath began at the intersection of Nestle and Clinton roads where a large barn lost its roof and two sides. Debris was blown over the adjoining house, landing inside a garage on the other side of the intersection, as well as up the road
about 40 feet .  A wooden silo located adjacent to the garage lost one entire side, thus collapsing inward inside the silo. The rest of the damage was mainly from snapped power poles and trees, as the path ended just west of Knauderack Creek, adjacent to Bower road.
	Trees and powerlines came down in Selkirk, Albany county, as well as Gilboa and Jefferson in Schoharie county. 
	At Ballston Lake, in Saratoga county, a microburst sheared off 8 forty-foot trees at the 10 to 20 foot level. One tree damaged a house. More trees and limbs fell in Clifton Park. 
	Another series of microbursts began in Ulster county about a mile northwest of the center of Esopus. They knocked down several clusters of trees as they neared State HIghway Route 9W, while moving in an easterly direction. Embedded within the microburst, an F1 tornado, touched down briefly to the east of Black Creek and 9W, less than a tenth of a mile south of the center of Esopus. The track of the tornado was about a quarter mile long and 25 to 50 yards wide with numerous trees pushed about 70 degrees to the left of the storm track. There was little property damage due to the tornado, but it was sighted by nearby residents. Meanwhile the series of microbursts continued across the Hudson river, into Dutchess county, blowing over over the estreme southern portion of Hydeo Park as well as the Poughkeepsie Yacht club in northern Poughkeepsie. Winds were clocked at 126 mph at the Poughkeepsie Yacht club. Several boats were overturned and damaged. A trailer was overturned. The roof was removed from the Yacht club. Damage from this microburst fanned out to a width of approximately one hundred yards, and a path length of up to a quarter of a mile.  The wind overturned a car. The roof was removed from the Yacht club. Damage from this microburst fanned out to a width of approximatley 100 yards, and a path length of up to a quarter of a mile. A car was damaged by a falling tree in Hyde Park. 
	A weaker F0 tornado, touched down in the Fairview section of the town of Poughkeepsie, about one quarter mile east of the Fairview Fire Station, on the leading edge of another microburst. The width was 25 yards, the length less than one hundred yards. Damage from the tornado was marginal, confined to downed trees and some minor structural damage to seven homes. 
	Thunderstorm winds produced damage in many other portions of Dutchess county. Another microburst produced damage between County Route 83, just north of U.S. Highway Route 44, east to the village of Leedsville. Damage included destruction to a barn on the Bel Air farm. Many trees were down in a huge swath with this microburst. There were unconfirmed sightings of  funnel clouds in this area.  Many trees fell in Millbrook, which was described as a war zone. Large trees were uprooted in Clinton Corners and falling trees knocked powerlines down in Rhinebeck. In Pawling, a large tree fell on power lines, then crashed onto a car, causing extensive damage. Trees were blown across a power line, which then fell on  Allyn's restaurant in the Town of Washington. Trees and poles were also blown down in the village of Fishkill. 
	Winds were clocked to 70 mph in Stone Ridge, and 60 mph at New Paltz, both in Ulster county. Many windows were smashed or blown out of buildings at the New Paltz S.U.N.Y. campus. Trees were blown over in Ellenville. A tree fell on the mayor's car in that town, destroying it. Another tree damaged a historical home.
	A 60 mph wind gust was also recoreded at Kinderhook, Columbia county. Two 50-foot concrete silos of a coach barn in Gallatin, Columbia county were obliterated. A door was blown off a nearby house. In the promixity of Gallatin, a car was destroyed by a fallen tree. Huge trees fell on Schneider road in Columbia county. Many trees were snapped off their bases in East Taghkanic. Shingles from a roof  were blown off in Cairo, Greene county and large trees fell on a house in and around the town of Phoenicia. A microburst uprooted many 22 to 24 inch diameter trees and snapped utility lines in the vicinity of Route 23, a few hundred yards north of the intersection of County Route 23A.  
	Dime size hail fell at Kerhonkson, Ulster county. Pea-size hail was noted at Tivoli and Clinton corners, both located in Dutchess county. While property damage with the hail was minimized, hail took a toll on apple orchards. Many apples were partially damaged by small hail in Ulster and Dutchess counties that produced permanent indentations on the apples, making them unusable for sale. Total crop damage could easily exceed a million dollars.
	Lightning took the life of two horses at a farm in Ballston Lake.
	 At the height of the storms, up to 52,000 customers, mainly in the Mid Hudson Valley region, were without power. 
	A funnel cloud was noted by two on-duty meteorologists at the National Weather Service office at Albany.

While property damage with the hail was minimized, hail took a toll on apple orchards. Many apples were partially damaged by small hail in Ulster and Dutchess counties that produced permanent indentations on the apples, making them unusable for sale. Total crop damage could easily exceed a million dollars.
	Lightning took the life of two horses at a farm in Ballston Lake.
	 At the height of the storms, up to 52,000 customers, mainly in the Mid Hudson Valley region, were without power. 
	A funnel cloud was noted by two on-duty meteorologists at the National Weather Service office at Albany.

Dozens of large, mature trees were stripped of most limbs, and many others were pushed over mostly in a northwestward direction, but not lofted. Then at the intersection of State Highway 45 and NS246 Road the property of the Green Valley Church sustained massive damage, most significant of which occurred to the community center, a 40 foot by 20 foot wooden structure that was completely destroyed. All exterior walls, 4 total, and the 2 interior walls were made of wood and entirely displaced from the foundation with debris located near the west edge of the foundation extending northwestward about 100 feet. On the same lot, just west and north of the community center, 3 to 4 large mature trees were either pushed over to the west and northwest or largely stripped of their limbs. The roof of the parsonage located approximately 50 feet north of the community center and just north of 2 pushed-over trees, also was heavily damaged. A 15 foot section of the gable-style roof was blown off the back side of the house and lofted eastward about 50 feet. Two large mature trees located northeast of the house were pushed over in a north-northwestward direction. Lesser damage on the property occurred to the garage, located immediately northeast of the community center, where several windows were broken and numerous roof shingles were missing. Several large bales of hay also rolled westward approximately 125 feet and were embedded in structure and tree debris. 

Damage to the Green Valley Community Center 6 miles SSW of Dacoma is the basis for the F2 rating. As the accompanying photo (below listing of tornado at 2225 CST) shows, this building was completely destroyed with most of the debris found to the northwest of the foundation. 

As the tornado tracked northeastward, a 1 mile long path of tree damage was evident on both sides of EW29 Road. Most trees had numerous limbs blown off or were damaged, while fewer trees were blown over, with the majority of trees north of the road blown over to the north and trees south of the road blown over to the east. Minor structural damage was also observed about 1/4 mile south of EW29 Road. Along NS249 Road an uninhabited house sustained significant damage to the east portion thought to be a garage, which was pushed over to the north. Numerous shingles were missing from the remainder of the house roof. A flag pole on the west side of the lot was bent to the northwest, while dozens of large mature trees north and northeast of the house were heavily damaged, with most of the them missing numerous limbs, while others were pushed over. This tree damage continued northward to EW27 Road. On the southeast side of Dacoma, an old barn was blown over, while another barn of tin construction had part of its roof blown off, with debris scattered northward a short distance. The tornado dissipated 1 mile east-northeast of Dacoma where 3-4 inch diameter tree limbs were downed.","Severe thunderstorms first developed across portions of western and northern Oklahoma during the evening of the 25th, resulting in 4 confirmed tornadoes, one rated F2, and other areas of straight-line wind damage and large hail.

At the intersection of EW29 Road and NS260 Road, very large limbs, some a foot or more in diameter, were blown off dozens of trees, while numerous other trees were pushed over. There was also damage to an oil storage tank made of metal. A telephone pole at the intersection was recently replaced and is assumed to have been downed during the tornado. A west to east chain link fence approximately 100 to 200 feet long was also downed southward. Major tree damage was then observed at a property about ½ mile northeast of this location with many trees laying in a westward direction. A well-designed brick home near the trees, lost dozens perhaps hundreds of shingles, especially on the west side of the house. About 1 mile northeast of this location another house sustained a broken window on the north side of the house and minor roof damage, consisting mostly of missing roof shingles. Metal siding was partially peeled back from a nearby storage barn, and a medium-aged pine tree on the west side of the house was snapped halfway to the top. Near the intersection of EW27 Road and NS262 Road damage was observed to 2 metal barns. One barn had sheet metal peeled back on the roof and west and east sides. The roof of a storage building was also blown off in an eastward direction and left nearly intact on the ground. About ½ to 1 mile north and east of this location a poorly constructed barn sustained minor roof and west-side wall damage, while another barn constructed of metal had its 2 west-facing doors blown inward and partially detached from its hinges. Continuing northward trees sustained major damage, and a grain storage silo was tossed a short distance eastward from its original location. The last area of damage was observed about ½ mile north of US Highway 64 on NS264 Road where 4 pieces of sheet metal were blown off a storage barn.","Severe thunderstorms first developed across portions of western and northern Oklahoma during the evening of the 25th, resulting in 4 confirmed tornadoes, one rated F2, and other areas of straight-line wind damage and large hail.

There was one report of 60 MPH winds as the storms passed through the Saylorville area in Polk County.  Heavy rain fell in a couple parts of the state.  One was with the supercell in Polk County, the other area of heavy rain was in Black Hawk County.  Rainfall amounts in parts of these two counties were in the two to four inch range, however little more than urban and small street flooding occurred due to dry soil conditions.",250

A nearly stationary front extended from Wisconsin, southwest through the northwest corner of Iowa, and into northern Kansas.  A round of convection moved across the state during the morning, leaving behind several outflow boundaries.  The mid levels of the atmosphere were quite warm, thus convection was capped during the afternoon hours.  A strong southerly flow of moist air spread into Iowa during the afternoon.  Temperatures approached 100 degrees F. over southwest Iowa.  Dew point temperatures reached the upper 60s to mid 70s across much of the south two thirds of the state.  Thunderstorms developed at the intersection of two outflow boundaries northwest of Des Moines, and also just ahead of the stationary front.  Surface based CAPE values were well over 5000 J/kg, thus the convection developed explosively.  Severe weather quickly followed.  There were numerous reports of hail.  Most of the hail was between one inch in diameter and golf ball size.  One of the cells, which happened to be the initial cell that formed at the boundary intersection, turned into a supercell.  Several tornadoes were spawned by this regenerating cell.  Most of the tornadoes were very weak and short lived.

The center section of the horse barn roof at Strand Arabian Stables was torn off.  Sheet metal from the horse barn roof littered surrounding yards, and one woman was cut by the sheet metal.  She was taken to St. Luke's Hospital where she was treated and released.  There were about 45 horses on the grounds of the stables when the tornado hit, but incredibly none were hurt.  A barn also collapsed along Lafayette Road. Ten cows were inside the barn, and one was killed. Damage was also found along East Otter Road.  A house had it's roof damaged and siding taken off, and a small shed was destroyed.  A minivan was pushed off of a driveway and had it's windows broken out.  A garage door was also pushed in on a garage.","Mesoanalysis during the early morning depicted an outflow boundary extending from Central Illinois into Central Iowa with a cold front extending from Northeast Iowa into Eastern Nebraska, intersecting the outflow interface near Des Moines.  An elevated bow MCS (Mesoscale Convective System) developed between Mason City and Marshalltown, and raced eastward into Eastern Iowa during the late morning and early afternoon.  This system packed high winds and heavy rain as it swept across Eastern Iowa, mainly along and north of Interstate 80.  Winds were measured at 60 to 70 mph over portions of the area, knocking down trees and limbs.  Recent rains had already saturated the ground throughout Northeast and East Central Iowa. Additional heavy rain with this system forced creeks and streams out of their banks in Buchanan County, washing out several roads.  The Little Wapsipinicon River at Fairbank was also sent out of it's banks. Doppler radar estimated rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour.  The heavy rain also caused Duck Creek in Davenport to rise to bankfull in areas, and flooded portions of the bike path and surrounding areas near Brady Street. The bow MCS also spawned two weak tornadoes, one which touched down briefly at Alburnett in Linn County, and the other at Center Junction in Jones County.",253
