The tornado moved northeast and tracked through the Beauvoir Lake subdivision where one house under construction was flattened and another house was partially deroofed with serious damage to the upper level. 

From Beauvoir Lake subdivision the tornado downed trees and removed shingles from house roofs in the Halcyon area. The tornado crossed Interstate 85 just west of the Taylor Road exit snapping off numerous pine trees in the interstate median. The tornado apparently ended at Taylor Road on the north side of the interstate. 

The tornado was rated at F1 based on structural damage in the Beauvoir Lake area. Much of the damage along the track was in the F0 category.  The tornado track was 2.2 miles in length and estimated to be about 100 yards wide at it's widest point. The tornado began at 6:29 PM and ended at 6:33 PM.

The tornado then began a east-northeast trajectory and removed a poorly fastened aluminum roof from a mobile home on Bud Street.  As the path direction became northeast, the next sporadic touchdown occurred at the Hudson High School where a portion of the gynasium roof was lifted, buckled and removed, while the nearby ballfield bleachers were flipped over by the tornado.

The tornado traveled five miles to a point three miles eastnortheast of Kokomo. The next tornado touched down about two miles east of Columbia and traveled six miles to a point seven miles eastnortheast of Columbia. The next tornado touched down nine miles eastnortheast of Columbia and traveled into Lamar County to a point four miles northeast of Oak Grove. The final tornado produced by the supercell in the Jackson NWS County Warning Area touched down in the northwest part of the city of Hattiesburg and traveled across northern sections of Hattiesburg and then across the city of Petal. This tornado lifted about two miles east of Petal. Damage reports in Marion County are somewhat difficult to estimate because an earlier tornado affected portions of the county, and the severe thunderstorm that produced the first tornado in the county caused damage in the city of Columbia before the second tornadic storm moved into the county. Damage to homes in Marion County from the tornado is estimated at $700,000 with other damage in the county listed under separate storms. The total damage from the tornado in Lamar County is estimated to have been around $4.5 million. In Lamar County, the tornado destroyed five houses, 24 mobile homes, one business, and 17 farms. The tornado caused major damage to 33 houses, 30 mobile homes, one church, two businesses, and seven farms. Minor damage occurred to approximately 30 mobile homes, eight  apartment units, one church, two businesses, and a farm. The total damage from the tornado in Forrest County was estimated to be around $6 million. In Forrest County, the tornado tracked through populated areas of Hattiesburg and Petal. The tornado caused major damage to 112 houses, one mobile home, eight businesses, and six vehicles. Additionally, the tornado caused minor damage to 223 houses, four mobile homes, and 21 businesses.

The tornado appeared to have first touched down where the home was located.  The youngest victim was home sick from school and her grandmother was watching her.  The girls father was working in a room that was attached to the home.  When the winds hit, the home was pulled out of the ground and rolled across a road and was completely demolished.  The room where the girls father was working was left standing.  Another "Double Wide" manufactured home, just west of the one that was destroyed, was picked up in the air,  blown across or through a clump of trees, and set down about 50 yards south of where it was tied down, in another clump of trees.  When viewing the home from a distance it appeared to have been purposely placed in the trees, with little outside damage visible.  However, when viewed form the inside, it looked as if an earthquake had hit it, with almost everything inside damaged.  Both of these manufactured homes were fairly new.  Both of the homes had the front tie downs pulled out of the ground and the anchors on the back of the homes snapped. The winds were estimated to be greater than 100 mph with the combination of the tornado and the intense downdraft from the "Bow Echo".  The tornado appeared to remain along the leading edge of the "Bow Echo" for a little over three miles.  Other homes suffered roof damage and numerous trees were blown down along the path of the tornado.  The tornado dissipated just before entering Butler county just west of Boykin.
