Summary for late 4/08/01 to early 4/09/01 event: (For additional details, see individual entries for the dates.)
A warm front pushed north through the day on 4/08/01, and extended across southern Iowa and northern Illinois during the evening hours.  The boundary combined with a surface wave riding along the front, and an upper-level low, to produce a variety of severe weather during the evening hours of 4/08/01, continuing into the early morning of 4/09/01.  Hail from 1/2 inch up to quarter sized was common across parts of northeast and east central Iowa.  A brief tornado touchdown occurred in Benton county, and that was the only touchdown of the event.  Thunderstorms winds destroyed a large shed in Muscatine county.  Some of the thunderstorms produced torrential rain, and caused  small streams to come out of their banks in Buchanan county.  Thunderstorms continued tracking into northwest Illinois, but hail reports ranged from 1/4 to 1/2 inch, below severe limits.",13

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.

In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.

A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.  A proclamation for emergency disaster assistance was signed.",95

A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.  A proclamation for emergency disaster assistance was signed.",99

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).

The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.

Nine buildings with major damage, 43 with minor.  Two buildings destroyed.  Two dead, three injured.","A very powerful storm system moved through the southern Rockies during the night of the 10th and early morning of the 11th.  Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.

A warm front lifted north across the state during the previous day, allowing a strong surge of moisture to flow north from the Gulf of Mexico.  Temperatures rose into the 70s to low 80s as surface dew point temperatures rose into the upper 50s and 60s across the state.  By the early evening hours, a frontal boundary extended from near Sioux City east-northeast into the northeast corner of the state.  Thunderstorms fired along this front and became severe during the evening.  These storms produced very heavy rain with numerous reports of hail.  For the most part, the hail was around an inch in diameter with the storms.  There were a few reports of hail up to the size of golf balls however.  Reports of golf ball size hail were received from the Ringsted area of Emmet County, and also from the Fraser area of Boone County.   Two things were taking place during the evening.  While the thunderstorms were firing along the warm front over northern Iowa, a strong low pressure system was racing out of Colorado.  CAPE values across northeast Kansas into Iowa were in the 2000 to 3000 J/Kg range as a dry line extending south from the low approached the area.  Strong thunderstorms developed over northeast Colorado and raced east across Nebraska and Kansas.  The thunderstorms took on a bow echo configuration as they headed across the Plains at more than 60 MPH.   High winds raked Nebraska and Kansas before moving into Iowa.  There were numerous reports of winds of 60 to 80 MPH as the line advanced across the west half of Iowa with numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  As the storms moved through Carroll County, several outbuildings were destroyed in the Templeton area.  Machine sheds were totally destroyed in Adair County by the high winds.  Further northwest, in Greene County, a barn was flattened north of Scranton.  Damage continued as the storms continued east with reports of outbuildings damaged or destroyed toward Hamilton County. One of the most damaging events of the night took place late in the storm cycle.  The storms turned into wind producers.  High winds hit the Lake Mills area in Winnebago County for example.  A barn and several sheds were destroyed by the winds around 80 MPH.   As the storms moved into Hardin County, a microburst occurred west of the Iowa Falls area with winds estimated around 85 MPH.  A tornado touched down briefly in the community of Alden, causing considerable damage in the town.  The tornado touched down in two locations of the town, damaging several buildings four blocks apart.    Concrete blocks were picked up and thrown 50 to 75 yards and roofs of the affected buildings were strewn one quarter to three eighths of a mile downstream.  One business was damages with estimated damage around $180,000.  On a farm at the edge of town damage was estimated at $100,000.  Numerous trees were downed on Highways 491 and D15, blocking travel in the area.  Shortly after this event occurred, the storms weakened and continued moving northeast.",132

The dry slot lifted north ahead of the low and passed over Iowa during the early morning hours of the 23rd.  Within the dry slot winds of 70 to 85 MPH were common just a few thousand feet above the surface.  Shortly after sunrise, a narrow band of showers formed over northeast Iowa.  As the showers moved through northeast they produced very gusty winds.  In Black Hawk and Bremer Counties, winds were in the 65 to 70 MPH range.  Damage was reported around the two counties.  Three miles northwest of Washburn in Black Hawk County a farm shed was completely destroyed.  In Bremer County, a farm shed was destroyed by the winds near Tripoli and damage to power poles was reported in the Readlyn area.    At the onset of the high winds a very narrow squall line developed.  Actually, forming near the cold core of the upper low pressure area, convective tops were very low with little if any lightning associated with them.  A tornado touched down briefly in Black Hawk County near Gilbertville.  One house was damaged and power was cut to three others.  The tornado lifted quickly and didn't touch down again until it was east of the Des Moines CWA.",150

The exit region of a vigorous mid-level jet streak helped create deep layer convergence in eastern Iowa along a surface cold front, during the morning of 4/23/01.  The atmosphere was only marginally unstable, but shear values were very high.  A study of the event at the NWS in the Quad Cities suggest that the tornado was non-descending in nature, with the rotation originating near the surface and building upward.  Spotters reported no lightning or thunder with the tornado, which the local study suggests indicated rapid development during the initial stages of the storm.  There was no evidence from radar data that a tornado occurred.  The tornado touched down near the middle school in  southwest Independence, and tracked through the west central and north central parts of the community, before lifting 3.5 miles northeast of Independence.  The  tornado path was continuous, 5 miles long and 1/8 mile wide.  The tornado was rated F1 on the Fujita scale following a NWS Survey. Three people suffered minor injuries from flying debris, and were treated at the local hospital.  Emergency management officials estimated the tornado caused a total of $ 1 million in damage. A total of 31 homes were damaged, two severely.  20 businesses and 20 vehicles were also damaged.",151
