The city of Milwaukee recorded it's earliest tornado ever (just before sunset), and an extremely large number of reports of large hail from 3/4 to 1.75 inches in diameter were relayed to the NWS Sullivan office.  Most of the thunderstorms developed gusty winds on the order of 30 to 50 mph, but one managed to generate a gust of 58 knots (67 mph) at the TV-4 station on the north side of Milwaukee.  The thunderstorm which dumped large hail 7 N of Portage also had winds that uprooted some trees and blew a car off of Inerstate 39.  An earlier thunderstorm that affected the west side of the city of Portage left the ground white with golf-ball size hail that also shattered several  vehicle windshields.  The thunderstorm that affected Wisconsin Dells also left the ground white with hail. 

The Milwaukee tornado spun up about 1/2 mile east/northeast of the terminal building of General Mitchell International Airport, just east of Runway 19, moved northeast and crossed East Layton Avenue just east of South Pennsylvania Avenue in Cudahy, continued northeast through St. Francis, and dissipated over the northwest corner of Nathanael Greene Park.  Apparently the tornado wasn't strong enough to cause any damage on the airport grounds, but it did cause considerable damage in Cudahy and St. Francis.  Fifty-three (53) residental homes sustained minor damage and eleven (11) had major damage. Eight (8) businesses sustained major damage.  Many motor vehicles were over-turned, several roofs were partially peeled off of homes, power lines and trees were toppled, and gas leaks were reported. Sixteen (16) people were injured enough to require medical treatment (lacerations), but there were no fatilities.  Most of the people who were injured were in their vehicles.  Based on this damage, it is estimated that maximum wind speeds of this tornado were 105 to 110 mph. The airport terminal building and control tower went on emergency power after commercial power was disrupted.  Airport control tower officials were able to divert airplane traffic, consequently there were no aircraft mishaps.  Preceding the tornado, there were reports of large hail and some tree damage in the forward flank downdraft of the parent thunderstorm over St. Francis and the southern part of the city of Milwaukee.  The tornado was extensively photographed and captured on video tape.  It briefly displayed multiple-vortex characterisitics.  The last time a tornado was documented in Milwaukee County was in May, 1989.

NWS Sullivan meteorologists speculate that an outflow boundary was pushed northwest to the airport area from a thunderstorm that earlier moved through the southeast corner of Milwaukee County. This outflow boundary may have focused low-level vorticity that helped generate the tornado.  The parent thunderstorm possessed a mesocyclone.  Synoptically, a deep low pressure was moving northeast through central Iowa toward northern Wisconsin.  This movement put southern Wisconsin in a "dry slot" associated with strong jet stream winds aloft.  The combination of surface dewpoints in the lower to mid 50s, strong speed shear between surface winds out of the south and southwest mid-level winds, sufficient instability due to daytime heating/temperatures in the 70s, and cold air aloft allowed thunderstorms to grow to 40,000 feet. Several thunderstorms had supercell characturistics, but only one was assoicated with a tornado, and another with a funnel cloud. Thunderstorm movement was northeast at 50 to 60 mph (about 47 to 51 knots).",10

				March 10, 2000 - Event Narrative

Early morning (400 AM-600 AM) thunderstorms occurred in an southwest to northeast line from near Breckenridge to Graham to south of Bowie, to near Sherman. While radar suggested dime to golf ball hail with some of these storms, no reports of hail were recieved.

Additional storms developed west of Eastland prior to 800 AM, and moved rapidly east across the area through midday, with the strongest storms moving from Stephenville to Cleburne to Wills Point. Mostly small hail and isolated high wind was reported with these storms, including a gust to 74 MPH at DFW Airport, doing minor damage at Irving.

Thunderstorms occurred during the late afternoon over the south central portions of north Texas, generally ending with sunset. Large hail fell briefly on the Fort Hood reservation, and a brief tornado was reported by a cooperative observer near Lake Belton. Scattered wind damage was reported in Limestone and Milam counties.",15

Damage included one abandoned mobile home that was overturned and destroyed, several carports and other low-grade roofs dislodged, and utility poles/lines downed.

The tornado moved northeast through open country taking out a line of 11 utility poles about 2 miles west of FM 866, then proceeded to the northeast and knocked down 4 additional poles at the intersection of FM 866 and State Highway 302.

Absolute confirmation of the tornado could not be gained due to the lack of damage in the path.  Tall grasses in the path gave little clue to the winds in this weak phenomenon.  The decision to classify this as a tornado was due to the extreme intensity of low level radar signatures as well as the fairly narrow damage path sustained over a three mile track.

Although utility poles were knocked over, this tornado was rated only as a high F0 due to the seemingly undisturbed vegetation.","A series of large supercell thunderstorms developed during the late evening and early morrning hours in advance of a strong upper level low pressure system.

The first tornado damage was reported near Castleberry High School, about four miles west of downtown Fort Worth (618 PM). Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 

	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him.

			Hill/Ellis/Navarro/Henderson Thunderstorm Narrative

This storm developed near Blum in northeast Hill county about 1815 CST, moving east and producing a brief tornado near Itasca. The storm moved into southern Ellis county, likely producing large hail west of Italy about 1830 CST and on the Ellis-Navarro county line around 1915 CST. The storm then slowed its forward movement, producing quarter size hail along I-45 south of Rice around 1945C. At Roane, one barn was destroyed, and another unroofed by a brief tornado ($10K) (1955C). The storm eventually produced another tornado near the small community of Bazette (around 2015CST), destroying three mobile homes, five barns, and damaging the roofs of two homes ($200K). The storm then moved across the Trinity River, downing trees and producing minor damage to a few residences at Trinidad. One resident took shelter after seeing a funnel, and after hearing a roar, went outside to find a tree blown over on their house (2030CST). At Malakoff, golf ball hail broke windows and stripped trees (2044CST). Near Athens, continuous hail for 30 minutes left hail up to golf ball size 6 inches deep. Damage estimated $50k.",100
