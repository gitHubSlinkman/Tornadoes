At it's widest, path width was estimated at 30 yards.  The tornado was witnessed by a naval officer who described the tornado as a well defined rope-like funnel which was occasionally lighted by exploding transformers and power line arching at the base of the funnel.  Damage along the path was confined to shingle damage to a number of homes, a power pole snapped off at it's base and a 3 foot diameter tree uprooted.

The tornado crossed SR 69 destroying a nearly complete shopping center which included a Winn Dixie store. East of SR 69 the tornado destroyed a number of houses and residential structures. 

As the tornado reached US 82 it destroyed a number of mobile homes where several deaths were reported. From US 82 the tornado continued northeasterly downing numerous trees and power lines and damaging residential structures. The tornado crossed I-20/59 just west of exit 77 where many trees were uprooted or snapped off. Minor damage occurred to the JVC manufacturing facility. 

At exit 77 a number of commercial structures including hotels, fast food restaurants, and truck stops sustained damage including a number of vehicles that were overturned. The tornado continued northeasterly for a couple of miles before dissipating rapidly. Ironically, the tornado dissipated as it moved into an open, unpopulated area. 

The tornado was spawned by a supercell thunderstorm that originated in Mississippi. This thunderstorm was responsible for additional tornado damage in St. Clair and Etowah counties.

Tuscaloosa EMA reported 11 fatalities with this tornado along with 144 injuries. Nine of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes, one in a vehicle, and one in a commercial building converted to residential use. Six of those killed were females and five were males.
