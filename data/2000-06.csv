Tornadoes, widespread and localized flash flooding, funnel clouds, damaging hurricane-force, straight-line winds associated with a wicked squall-line, large hail stones, urban/small flooding, lightning strikes, and significant mainstem river flooding were reported.  As in the preceding weeks, a quasi-stationary front over northern Illinois served as a boundary for warm, moist, unstable air to be pulled north over the cooler air over Wisconsin.  Leftover flooding (from the evening of May 31, 2000) and isolated severe thunderstorms were noted during the pre-dawn to mid morning hours.  However a powerful squall-line formed along the Mississippi River in the La Crosse area by mid-afternoon, and pushed into south-central Wisconsin by late afternoon with "all hell breaking loose."   After the squall line moved into the southeast part of the state, it was followed by widespread showers and thunderstorms that triggered additional flooding problems. The east/southeast moving storms would not end until around 2300CST.  As a result of the wild weather events, a State of Emergency was declared in Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Rock, and Sauk counties.  Numerous power lines were knocked down by felled trees or wind gusts outright, resulting in the lose of power to 20,000 customers.  Significant storm and flooding events will be summarized below county by county.

Marquette Co:  6 homes were damaged and trees uprooted by powerful winds estimated at 70 knots (80 mph) in Briggsville. Urban flooding in Briggsville was also noted with water 6 inches deep.

Green Lake Co:  powerful winds knocked down trees in both Kingston and Markesan, and large hail was noted.

Fond du Lac Co: a brief, F0 tornado spun up in the rural area southeast of Oak Center. Only some hay crop was damaged. Elsewhere, urban flooding and large hail was noted. Between 1700 and 1900CST, 1.71 inches of rain fell in the city of Fond du Lac.

Sheboygan Co: powerful thunderstorm winds pushed over trees in the southern portions. 

Sauk Co: powerful winds blew over large trees in the Reedsburg to Baraboo area as well as around Prairie du Sac.  Then the heavens oped up as 3.75 inches of rain fell between 1600 and 1645CST in North Freedom. There were other reports of up to 6 inches of rain falling in 2 hours.  Flash flooding developed along Narrows Creek which left mud marks 8 feet high on some buildings. So much water came down Narrows Creek that it temporarily backed up the water of the Baraboo River!  The Baraboo River flooded homes, and other creeks tore pieces of Highways 12 and 113 away.  Road beds and parking lots were ripped away on the south side of Baraboo.  Some railroad beds and many drainage culverts across the county were washed away.  Severe erosion was noted on the cliffs overlooking the north shore of Devils Lake, whose water level rose about 3 feet due to runoff.  All together, 153 residential homes were damaged, 17 businesses reported water damage, and 220,000 acres of farm land sustained water or erosion damage.  The flooding was more widespread and worse than the 1993 flood, based on newspaper accounts.  The Baraboo River near Baraboo crested at 22.04 feet on June 2nd, or 6.04 feet above flood stage (moderate flooding), after rising above flood stage at 0400CST on the 1st.  Upriver at Rock Springs, the flood stage of 18.5 feet was exceeded at 1630CST on the 1st, and the crest was 21.71 feet at 0750CST on the 2nd (major flooding).  

Columbia Co: powerful winds uprooted large trees in and around Portage.  In addition, a garage was damaged, several vehicles were blown into roadside ditches quickly reached a depth of 1 to 3 feet over portions of Highway 12 around Portage, and on Highway 73 in the southeast corner where residents were evacuated.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were reported on some roads. Agricultural crop damage and soil erosion were also noted.

Dodge Co: the main event was a long-lived tornado that spun up just south of Highway S about 4 miles south of Horicon, just southwest of the intersection of Highways S and E.  Eyewitness accounts suggested that this tornado was a rain-wrapped and multi-vortex as it hopped-skipped east/southeast through the heart of the village of Iron Ridge (F2 at this time, 140-50 mph wind), before exiting the county on Highway S.  All together, this F2 tornado destroyed 6 homes, and damaged 26 other homes, 6 businesses, 2 barns, 1 silo, semi-tractor trailer, a green house, and many cars.  It destroyed 5 agricultural buildings. No one was injured or killed by this early-warned tornado.  Five other barns were damaged in the county by the powerful straight-line winds associated with the squall-line.  In addition, large hail up to walnut size was noted.  Flash flooding was reported in the southeast part of the county when 1.5 inches of rain fell in a short period of time.  Soil erosion and shoulder washouts were reported near the intersection of Highways 60 and P, south of Rubicon.

Washington Co: the Dodge County tornado continued into Washington County for about 1.5 miles near and along Highway S.  It damaged a barn and silo and uprooted more trees before dissipating.  The tornado in this county had winds estimated at 80 mph, or F1 strength.  No one was injured or killed.  Flash flooding was reported south of Hartford where soil erosion and gravel shoulder washouts occurred due to swirling flood waters.  Otherwise, large hail and tree-uprooting winds were noted in Germantown.

Iowa Co: Pre-dawn flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of Iowa County due to leftover thunderstorms that hit the county on May 31st.  Morrey Creek overflowed it banks in the village of Avoca, damaging 35 homes and eroding surrounding landscaping.  In Dodge State Park near Dodgeville, 50 miles of trails were closed after several bridges were washed out by flooding waters.  In addition, gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted on several roads.   Another round of flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of the county thanks to torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the late afternoon and early evening hours. An estimated 10,250 acres sustained major soil erosion and many roads had water depths of 1 to 3 feet as water currents washed away gravel shoulders. Crop damage was extensive.  

Dane Co: pre-dawn severe storms dumped large hail and knocked down many tree limbs in the Madison area.  During the same storm, lightning struck a west-side Madison hotel, resulting in damage to its electrical system.  Urban/small stream flooding was noted in the pre-dawn hours across the northern part of the county with water covering low spots on Highways 12, 73, and 113.  A couple streets were flooded and closed in the village of Mazomanie due to high water levels on the Black Earth Creek. Sandbagging was needed to protect about a dozen homes in Mazomanie.  Powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees which then damaged many vehicles in the Madison to Cottage Grove area during the evening.  At least 60 trees blocked various roads in the Madison area, and 18 power lines were reported down.  Roof tiles were also removed from some homes as the winds gusted to an estimated 70 knots (80 mph).  An expensive gazebo was destroyed by uprooted trees in the city of Monona.  Shortly thereafter, flash-flood producing rains hit much of the county.  Madison streets were rivers as 27 cars were stranded or pushed around.  It was the worst flooding the city during the past 15 years.  Sandbagging commenced in Monona to protect homes.  Many roads across the county were damaged by flood waters, with most damage in the northwest part of the county.   In the village of Oregon, 1.90 inches of rain was measured in just 45 minutes ending at 1830CST.   Additional soil erosion and ponding of water resulted in extensive, severe crop damage across the county.  Collectively, wind and/or flood damage occurred to at least 646 residential homes in the county, and to 3 businesses.  Probably 30,000 acres of farm land had significant crop damage.  A new daily rainfall record of 3.46 inches was set at Madison's Traux Field, breaking the old record of 1.33 inches set back in 1892.  Runoff from this rainfall eventually pushed Lake Mendota to 31.5 inches above its normal summer level on June 5th, which was the highest reading since the beginning of records in 1916.  In response to the high lake levels in Dane county, many nearby homes were sandbagged, and public beach and boat docks were closed.

Jefferson Co: an early morning, severe thunderstorm dumped large hail on Lake Mills.  Another storm's lightning struck a Ft. Atkinson church steeple, resulting in structural and water damage. The evening storms generated damaging winds that uprooted large trees.  Lightning started a minor fire on a Lake Mills home's roof.  Heavy rains of 2 to 3 inches during the evening generated scattered flash flooding across the county, mostly in the form of gravel shoulder washouts of several roads.  Roads near the Rock River in Ft. Atkinson were closed due to the swirling waters.  Soil erosion and crop washouts were noted across the county.  Rainfall totals of 2.39 inches and 2.72 inches were noted in Ft. Atkinson and Jefferson, respectively.  The heavy rains forced the Crawfish River at Milford to exceed the flood stage of 7 feet on June 2nd , and crest at 8.38 feet on June 7th (moderate flooding). 

Waukesha Co: powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees in the Genesee area.

Milwaukee Co: large hail was reported in the city of Milwaukee.  Torrential rains of around 2 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the city of Fox Point resulted in flash flooding in that city. Landscaping damage and some road damage was noted due to swift water currents.

Lafayette Co: a brief tornado occurred north of Calamine. It damaged 2 large pole sheds and uprooted many trees along its short path. Several calves were injured as they were pushed across the road. Eyewitness accounts suggest this F1 tornado (winds about 100 mph) was rain-wrapped.  Otherwise, the squall line's powerful winds uprooted trees and over-turned a car-trailer combo east of Belmont.  Similar to other counties, flash-flood producing rains followed the winds.  Across the county, all mainstem river, stream, creeks, and other low spots experienced flash flooding.  Bridge under-cutting was noted on Highway K outside of Gratiot, on Highway H in Jenkynsville, and Highway G in the northwest corner.  Moderate to severe damage to road shoulders and washed out driveways was noted countywide.  Twenty-one roads were closed at one time or another.  At least 75 residential homes and 5 businesses reported flood damage, while 2 private utility buildings suffered damage.  Two farm buildings were destroyed by the flood waters, and 15 others damaged.  About 7000 acres of farm land were severely damaged.  The Pecatonica River in Darlington closed down Highway 23 from the south. The river at this location exceeded the flood stage of 11 feet late on May 31st, and crested at 15.77 feet at 0730CST on June 1st (moderate flooding).  Near South Wayne, lightning started a minor house fire.

Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the southwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lying roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had minor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River State Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths.  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many years.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown exceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (moderate flooding).

Rock Co: powerful thunderstorm winds downed large trees in scattered parts of the county.  However, flash-flood producing rains hit during the evening hours. Most mainstem and nearly all streams and creeks jumped their banks. Nine roads along Lake Koshkonong sustained washout damage due to swift water currents. At least 100 homes outside of the major cities sustained damage.  Many Beloit and Janesville homes in low spots reported landscape flood damage as well as basement flooding. Flash flood waters also tore through farm fields, leaving moderate to severe soil erosion and crop damage to at least 20,000 acres.  Flood waters from the Sugar River in the southwest corner of the county closed roads west of the village of Avon.

Walworth Co: no damage reports.

Kenosha Co: several rounds of heavy rains during the evening on top of previously saturated soils and high river levels resulted in flash flooding scattered across the county.  Several roads had fast-flowing waters 1 to 3 feet deep which resulted in shoulder washouts and cars being swept into roadside ditches.  At least 75 homes sustained significant flood damage in the Wheatland, Salem, and Silver Lake areas.  About 47,000 acres of farm land had serious soil erosion, and washed or flooded crops.  Due to rainfall totals during the evening of 2 to 3 inches, the Fox River at New Munster continued to rise and would eventually crest at 12.76 feet early on June 3rd, or 2.76 feet above flood stage. Three homes Silver Lake homes were evacuated.",3

Most mainstem and nearly all streams and creeks jumped their banks. Nine roads along Lake Koshkonong sustained washout damage due to swift water currents. At least 100 homes outside of the major cities sustained damage.  Many Beloit and Janesville homes in low spots reported landscape flood damage as well as basement flooding. Flash flood waters also tore through farm fields, leaving moderate to severe soil erosion and crop damage to at least 20,000 acres.  Flood waters from the Sugar River in the southwest corner of the county closed roads west of the village of Avon.

Walworth Co: no damage reports.

Kenosha Co: several rounds of heavy rains during the evening on top of previously saturated soils and high river levels resulted in flash flooding scattered across the county.  Several roads had fast-flowing waters 1 to 3 feet deep which resulted in shoulder washouts and cars being swept into roadside ditches.  At least 75 homes sustained significant flood damage in the Wheatland, Salem, and Silver Lake areas.  About 47,000 acres of farm land had serious soil erosion, and washed or flooded crops.  Due to rainfall totals during the evening of 2 to 3 inches, the Fox River at New Munster continued to rise and would eventually crest at 12.76 feet early on June 3rd, or 2.76 feet above flood stage. Three homes Silver Lake homes were evacuated.",4

A surface low pressure moved northeast along the front during the previous night and was located to the north of Iowa on the afternoon of the first.  A mid level cap of warm air was in place over most of Iowa, preventing convection from firing until the late afternoon hours.  Surface based CAPE was in excess of 5000 J/kg by the mid afternoon hours.  A line of thunderstorms erupted along the cold front by the late afternoon hours.  The sheer profile was somewhat weak and thus most of the storms remained below severe limits.  Storms did become severe along one area of the line in Wapello and a small part of Mahaska Counties.  The main outcome of the severe storms was high winds and hail.  Winds as high as 75 MPH were reported by law enforcement officials in Wapello County.  There were numerous trees toppled by the winds and power line damage was reported as well.  Hail up to the size of golf balls was reported in Chillicothe.  The north edge of the storm produced nickle size hail and 60 MPH winds over southeast Mahaska County as well.  One tornado was observed as it passed north of the Ottumwa area.  The tornado caused little damage as it tracked across open country.",5

Tornadoes, widespread and localized flash flooding, funnel clouds, damaging hurricane-force, straight-line winds associated with a wicked squall-line, large hail stones, urban/small flooding, lightning strikes, and significant mainstem river flooding were reported.  As in the preceding weeks, a quasi-stationary front over northern Illinois served as a boundary for warm, moist, unstable air to be pulled north over the cooler air over Wisconsin.  Leftover flooding (from the evening of May 31, 2000) and isolated severe thunderstorms were noted during the pre-dawn to mid morning hours.  However a powerful squall-line formed along the Mississippi River in the La Crosse area by mid-afternoon, and pushed into south-central Wisconsin by late afternoon with "all hell breaking loose."   After the squall line moved into the southeast part of the state, it was followed by widespread showers and thunderstorms that triggered additional flooding problems. The east/southeast moving storms would not end until around 2300CST.  As a result of the wild weather events, a State of Emergency was declared in Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Green, Iowa, Lafayette, Rock, and Sauk counties.  Numerous power lines were knocked down by felled trees or wind gusts outright, resulting in the lose of power to 20,000 customers.  Significant storm and flooding events will be summarized below county by county.

Marquette Co:  6 homes were damaged and trees uprooted by powerful winds estimated at 70 knots (80 mph) in Briggsville. Urban flooding in Briggsville was also noted with water 6 inches deep.

Green Lake Co:  powerful winds knocked down trees in both Kingston and Markesan, and large hail was noted.

Fond du Lac Co: a brief, F0 tornado spun up in the rural area southeast of Oak Center. Only some hay crop was damaged. Elsewhere, urban flooding and large hail was noted. Between 1700 and 1900CST, 1.71 inches of rain fell in the city of Fond du Lac.

Sheboygan Co: powerful thunderstorm winds pushed over trees in the southern portions. 

Sauk Co: powerful winds blew over large trees in the Reedsburg to Baraboo area as well as around Prairie du Sac.  Then the heavens oped up as 3.75 inches of rain fell between 1600 and 1645CST in North Freedom. There were other reports of up to 6 inches of rain falling in 2 hours.  Flash flooding developed along Narrows Creek which left mud marks 8 feet high on some buildings. So much water came down Narrows Creek that it temporarily backed up the water of the Baraboo River!  The Baraboo River flooded homes, and other creeks tore pieces of Highways 12 and 113 away.  Road beds and parking lots were ripped away on the south side of Baraboo.  Some railroad beds and many drainage culverts across the county were washed away.  Severe erosion was noted on the cliffs overlooking the north shore of Devils Lake, whose water level rose about 3 feet due to runoff.  All together, 153 residential homes were damaged, 17 businesses reported water damage, and 220,000 acres of farm land sustained water or erosion damage.  The flooding was more widespread and worse than the 1993 flood, based on newspaper accounts.  The Baraboo River near Baraboo crested at 22.04 feet on June 2nd, or 6.04 feet above flood stage (moderate flooding), after rising above flood stage at 0400CST on the 1st.  Upriver at Rock Springs, the flood stage of 18.5 feet was exceeded at 1630CST on the 1st, and the crest was 21.71 feet at 0750CST on the 2nd (major flooding).  

Columbia Co: powerful winds uprooted large trees in and around Portage.  In addition, a garage was damaged, several vehicles were blown into roadside ditches quickly reached a depth of 1 to 3 feet over portions of Highway 12 around Portage, and on Highway 73 in the southeast corner where residents were evacuated.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were reported on some roads. Agricultural crop damage and soil erosion were also noted.

Dodge Co: the main event was a long-lived tornado that spun up just south of Highway S about 4 miles south of Horicon, just southwest of the intersection of Highways S and E.  Eyewitness accounts suggested that this tornado was a rain-wrapped and multi-vortex as it hopped-skipped east/southeast through the heart of the village of Iron Ridge (F2 at this time, 140-50 mph wind), before exiting the county on Highway S.  All together, this F2 tornado destroyed 6 homes, and damaged 26 other homes, 6 businesses, 2 barns, 1 silo, semi-tractor trailer, a green house, and many cars.  It destroyed 5 agricultural buildings. No one was injured or killed by this early-warned tornado.  Five other barns were damaged in the county by the powerful straight-line winds associated with the squall-line.  In addition, large hail up to walnut size was noted.  Flash flooding was reported in the southeast part of the county when 1.5 inches of rain fell in a short period of time.  Soil erosion and shoulder washouts were reported near the intersection of Highways 60 and P, south of Rubicon.

Washington Co: the Dodge County tornado continued into Washington County for about 1.5 miles near and along Highway S.  It damaged a barn and silo and uprooted more trees before dissipating.  The tornado in this county had winds estimated at 80 mph, or F1 strength.  No one was injured or killed.  Flash flooding was reported south of Hartford where soil erosion and gravel shoulder washouts occurred due to swirling flood waters.  Otherwise, large hail and tree-uprooting winds were noted in Germantown.

Iowa Co: Pre-dawn flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of Iowa County due to leftover thunderstorms that hit the county on May 31st.  Morrey Creek overflowed it banks in the village of Avoca, damaging 35 homes and eroding surrounding landscaping.  In Dodge State Park near Dodgeville, 50 miles of trails were closed after several bridges were washed out by flooding waters.  In addition, gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted on several roads.   Another round of flash flooding occurred across the northern portion of the county thanks to torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the late afternoon and early evening hours. An estimated 10,250 acres sustained major soil erosion and many roads had water depths of 1 to 3 feet as water currents washed away gravel shoulders. Crop damage was extensive.  

Dane Co: pre-dawn severe storms dumped large hail and knocked down many tree limbs in the Madison area.  During the same storm, lightning struck a west-side Madison hotel, resulting in damage to its electrical system.  Urban/small stream flooding was noted in the pre-dawn hours across the northern part of the county with water covering low spots on Highways 12, 73, and 113.  A couple streets were flooded and closed in the village of Mazomanie due to high water levels on the Black Earth Creek. Sandbagging was needed to protect about a dozen homes in Mazomanie.  Powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees which then damaged many vehicles in the Madison to Cottage Grove area during the evening.  At least 60 trees blocked various roads in the Madison area, and 18 power lines were reported down.  Roof tiles were also removed from some homes as the winds gusted to an estimated 70 knots (80 mph).  An expensive gazebo was destroyed by uprooted trees in the city of Monona.  Shortly thereafter, flash-flood producing rains hit much of the county.  Madison streets were rivers as 27 cars were stranded or pushed around.  It was the worst flooding the city during the past 15 years.  Sandbagging commenced in Monona to protect homes.  Many roads across the county were damaged by flood waters, with most damage in the northwest part of the county.   In the village of Oregon, 1.90 inches of rain was measured in just 45 minutes ending at 1830CST.   Additional soil erosion and ponding of water resulted in extensive, severe crop damage across the county.  Collectively, wind and/or flood damage occurred to at least 646 residential homes in the county, and to 3 businesses.  Probably 30,000 acres of farm land had significant crop damage.  A new daily rainfall record of 3.46 inches was set at Madison's Traux Field, breaking the old record of 1.33 inches set back in 1892.  Runoff from this rainfall eventually pushed Lake Mendota to 31.5 inches above its normal summer level on June 5th, which was the highest reading since the beginning of records in 1916.  In response to the high lake levels in Dane county, many nearby homes were sandbagged, and public beach and boat docks were closed.

Jefferson Co: an early morning, severe thunderstorm dumped large hail on Lake Mills.  Another storm's lightning struck a Ft. Atkinson church steeple, resulting in structural and water damage. The evening storms generated damaging winds that uprooted large trees.  Lightning started a minor fire on a Lake Mills home's roof.  Heavy rains of 2 to 3 inches during the evening generated scattered flash flooding across the county, mostly in the form of gravel shoulder washouts of several roads.  Roads near the Rock River in Ft. Atkinson were closed due to the swirling waters.  Soil erosion and crop washouts were noted across the county.  Rainfall totals of 2.39 inches and 2.72 inches were noted in Ft. Atkinson and Jefferson, respectively.  The heavy rains forced the Crawfish River at Milford to exceed the flood stage of 7 feet on June 2nd , and crest at 8.38 feet on June 7th (moderate flooding). 

Waukesha Co: powerful thunderstorm winds uprooted trees in the Genesee area.

Milwaukee Co: large hail was reported in the city of Milwaukee.  Torrential rains of around 2 inches in 1 to 2 hours in the city of Fox Point resulted in flash flooding in that city. Landscaping damage and some road damage was noted due to swift water currents.

Lafayette Co: a brief tornado occurred north of Calamine. It damaged 2 large pole sheds and uprooted many trees along its short path. Several calves were injured as they were pushed across the road. Eyewitness accounts suggest this F1 tornado (winds about 100 mph) was rain-wrapped.  Otherwise, the squall line's powerful winds uprooted trees and over-turned a car-trailer combo east of Belmont.  Similar to other counties, flash-flood producing rains followed the winds.  Across the county, all mainstem river, stream, creeks, and other low spots experienced flash flooding.  Bridge under-cutting was noted on Highway K outside of Gratiot, on Highway H in Jenkynsville, and Highway G in the northwest corner.  Moderate to severe damage to road shoulders and washed out driveways was noted countywide.  Twenty-one roads were closed at one time or another.  At least 75 residential homes and 5 businesses reported flood damage, while 2 private utility buildings suffered damage.  Two farm buildings were destroyed by the flood waters, and 15 others damaged.  About 7000 acres of farm land were severely damaged.  The Pecatonica River in Darlington closed down Highway 23 from the south. The river at this location exceeded the flood stage of 11 feet late on May 31st, and crested at 15.77 feet at 0730CST on June 1st (moderate flooding).  Near South Wayne, lightning started a minor house fire.

Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the southwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lying roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had minor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River State Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths.  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many years.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown exceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (moderate flooding).

The storms began in western Massachusetts during the late afternoon, with numerous reports of downed trees, wires, and large hail in Hampshire and Hampden Counties.  Hail as large as golf balls was reported in Granby.

Northampton received the brunt of the storm damage, where a brief tornado and microburst caused extensive damage and one injury.  The tornado, rated F1 on the Fujita Scale with winds of 73 to 112 mph, touched down very briefly at 5 pm EDT in the higher elevations in Leeds, in the northwest section of Northampton.  A few minutes later, the same tornado briefly touched down again near Bridge Road in the Pine Brook Farm portion of Northampton.  The initial touchdown was only 15 yards wide at its maximum, about one half mile long, and lasted only one minute.  It began near Kennedy Road, just to the west of the southern portion of Roberts Meadow Reservoir.  It ended on the east side of the reservoir at Reservoir Road.  Convergent tree damage was noted in these areas.  The majority of the damage from this severe thunderstorm occurred from a very powerful microburst, with estimated winds between 90 and 105 mph, which affected the section of Northampton around Pine Brook Curve, Emily Lane, and Hatfield Street.  Straight line wind damage was observed in this area, with large trees snapped in the middle, and in some cases at their bases.  Four homes were declared uninhabitable due to large trees which had fell upon them.  Hundreds of trees were downed as well as power lines.  Hail, ranging in size from quarter to golf ball, accompanied this storm.  Amazingly, only one minor injury occurred.  A man was struck by a tree which fell into his kitchen, but was spared by his refrigerator, which acted as a shield according to several accounts.

In central and eastern Massachusetts, thunderstorm winds downed trees, branches, and power lines throughout many communities in Worcester, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Plymouth Counties.  Dime to nickel size hail also accompanied the storms.  At Logan International Airport in Boston, a wind gust to 62 mph was reported.

About 15,000 electric customers lost power during the storms as they moved through Massachusetts.",9

The conclusions were that the damage, which occurred around 630 pm June 2nd, was tornadic and rated as 0 on the Fujita scale (F-0). This rating estimates the wind speed between 40 and 72 mph.

The survey began near Essex Street where damage appeared to be straight line, with several trees laying in the same direction. One tree fell through a parked car. Although the damage did not show a tornadic pattern, it was curious how isolated the damage was. Witnesses at the scene claimed there was a lull in the storm, then a sudden whistling and then the sound of a "freight train." One man claimed to see rapid rotation within the rain as the trees were lifted and pushed over. 

Further damage was witnessed a few tenths of a mile to the east on Scarborough Circle. Several trees were knocked down toward the east-southeast. One tree downed caused considerable damage to a porch/deck. Again the consensus was the wind was straight line, albeit curiously isolated.

Minor damage also occurred along East Lake Shore Drive. Shingles were torn off one house and a few shallow rooted trees were toppled in convergent directions. A fence to a tennis court across the street was bent over. A witness from this scene claimed to have seen "a cloud touch down and begin to move across the lake", right in line with the main damage path.

Further to the east-southeast, more damage was discovered. Four or five trees were twisted mid to low trunk and sheared off. The trunks were estimated at 8-10 inches. Witnesses in a nearby house claimed the storm seemed to have stopped, and then  the rain and strong, damaging wind wrapped back in. 

Behind this damage to the west-northwest was an ascending field leading up to a ridge top. This area comprises an unfinished golf course. Further investigation led to far more tree and vegetative damage. It was noted along the hill that damage increased in coverage further up, lending credence to the theory of a funnel aloft with the ridge rising up to meet the rotation. Numerous large trees were uprooted and fell in convergent patterns, and there were also trees twisted and sheared off from their lower to middle trunks.   

At the top of the ridge, a home was discovered with 18 large diameter trees (8-10") uprooted, sheared off, or twisted along the mid-high trunks. Some of the uprooted trees appeared to be in a convergent pattern. A gentleman interviewed was not home at the time of the storm. A couple trees narrowly missed a direct hit on his home, but crushed a corner of the residence's back deck.

Based upon the previously described eyewitness accounts, and the twisting / convergent damage pattern of many trees, the storm was determined to be a weak tornado. Track information from a global geo-positioning unit clearly exhibited a west-northwest to east-southeast oriented path of about 1 mile in length. The tornado was up to 200 yards wide near the ridge top with smaller damage swaths in downhill locations. The tornado was likely aloft for much of the storm, with ground interaction most numerous where the ridge rose up to meet it.","",10

Lines of severe thunderstorms swept southeast across the region.  They produced one F1 tornado, one funnel cloud, and high winds that downed many trees and power lines and caused at least 11 injuries, 8 of which were in New York City.

Based on a storm survey performed by NWS staff, an F1 tornado occurred around 7:05 pm EDT in the continental village region of the town of Cortlandt, about 3 miles north of Peekskill on the Westchester and Putnam Counties border.  The tornado was classified as an F1 based on tree damage and their associated patterns.  Touch down was on the southwest corner of the intersection of Highland Drive and Heath Terrace.  The tornado moved northeast along the southeast shore of Cortlandt Lake in a counter-clockwise arched pattern lifting just south of the intersection of Schuyler Lane and Putnam Road.  The Path Length was about 0.3 miles and Path Width averaged 33 yards.  In the vicinity of Tyron Circle and Putnam Road, the tornado was at its' widest and strongest.  Damage occurred to about 20 houses, with 7 houses incurring moderate damage.  The tornado apparently reformed in 2 other locations as the severe thunderstorm moved east:  Sprout Brook Road (Path Length about 0.15 miles) and Lakeview Road (Path Length just less than 0.1 miles).  Numerous trees of 1 1/2 to 2 feet in diameter were snapped, mainly about 20 to 25 feet above the ground.  Three telephone poles were snapped in the middle.  Meteorologically, this tornado formed on the roll of a gust front that moved nearly 50 mph across the region and was likely on the ground for less than 1 minute.

Here's a brief summary of damage reports received:

In Orange County, a 60 mph wind gust was reported at the Plattekill Service Area along the NYS Thruway, just north of Leptondale.  There were numerous reports of wires down, trees down on houses and cars and trees blocking roads in the vicinity of Wawayanda, Middletown, Cornwall, Goshen, Chester, and Newburgh.

In Rockland County, a tree fell on and damaged a house on Mountain Avenue in Hillburn.  Trees were also downed in New City.  A large tree fell on a car in Haverstraw.

In Putnam County, several trees and power lines were downed in Carmel and Brewster.

In Westchester County, numerous trees were downed at Croton On Hudson, numerous trees and power lines were downed at Ossining, a tree fell on a house at Yonkers, and trees were downed in Valhalla.

In Bronx County, numerous trees were downed countywide.

In Kings County, one person was injured when a large store sign fell on top of people.  A large inflatable structure was blown over.  Lightning struck a tent at Old Fulton and Everett Streets around 8:40 pm EDT, which caused 5 injuries.

In New York County, a scaffold collapsed on 7 cars at 94th Street and Second Avenue at 7:55 pm EDT.  Debris blew off a scaffold and fell on and injured one person at 84th Street and Broadway around 8:00 pm.  A tree fell on and injured one child at 214th Street and Indian Road around 8:00 pm.  At Central Park, a peak wind gust of 38 mph occurred from the north at 7:38 pm.

In Queens County, a spotter estimated a wind gust to 80 mph that caused a building collapse in Rockaway Beach.  Numerous trees were downed in Queens Village.  At JFK Airport, a peak wind gust of 45 mph occurred from the northwest at 7:59 pm EDT.  At LaGuardia Airport, a peak wind gust of 44 mph occurred from the northwest at 7:42 pm.

In Nassau County, a 60 mph wind gust caused wind damage in Levittown.

In Suffolk County, high winds downed trees in Stony Brook and Setauket.  One tree fell onto a car that injured a passenger on Lower Sheep Pasture Road around 8:03 pm EDT.  An airplane pilot saw a funnel cloud and reported 0.75-inch diameter hail in Smithtown around 8:12 pm.  A large tree was downed in Wading River around 8:17 pm.",11

A dynamic upper level system approached Iowa from the northwest during the afternoon.  Several boundaries were in the area resulting from weak convection that took place during the morning.  Very strong theta-e advection took place over northeast Nebraska during the morning and early afternoon hours.  In addition, several other factors came into play.  Moisture continued to stream into Iowa from the remnants of Hurricane Carlotta as precipitable water values approached 2.2 inches.  Iowa was also under the influence of a coupled jet structure.  As a result a strong upper level divergent field was in place over the state.  By afternoon, mid and upper level cold air advection began to take place as well.  Strong convection took place by mid day over northeast Nebraska into west central Iowa.   The line of thunderstorms moved into rich air with surface dew points in the low to mid 70s.  The main feature with the storms was high winds.  The line of thunderstorms took on a bow echo configuration as it moved across southern Iowa.  Most of the southern three tiers of counties reported high winds.  Wind speeds of 60 to as much as 85 MPH were reported with the storms.  Wind speeds topped out at 85 MPH at New Virginia, in Warren County.  Damage was widespread with numerous trees and power lines downed by the winds.  Some trees up to 2 feet in diameter were snapped.  A flag pole was reported bent 4 inches by the high winds as well.  One tornado was reported in Warren County as well.  This was a brief tornado near St Marys which caused no damage.  The other problem with the storms was the heavy rainfall.  Two to three inches of rain fell in many areas.  As the storms moved into parts of south central and southeast Iowa, they moved into area that had been inundated by heavy rainfall just two nights before.  Flash flooding was reported in Appanoose, Lucas, Mahaska, Monroe, Wayne, Davis, and Wapello Counties.  Numerous roads were under water in these counties.    U.S. Highway 63 was closed by high water  north of Ottumwa.  Some of the worst flooding took place in Mahaska County where heavy rain fell on areas that had been flooded two days before.  At least 15 roads were reported under water in the county.  As the thunderstorms moved through Hamilton County, lightning struck a tree outside of a house in Stratford.  It also left a hole in the ground and caused damage inside the house.  The lightning strike broke windows out of the front of the house and also caused windows to break in the house next door.  Later, the storms moved into the Waterloo area.  Lightning struck the chimney of a former school building.  The top part of the chimney was blown off by the lightning and a good part of the rest of the chimney was damaged.",133

The damage path extended from Gothenburg to Beaver City and Stamford.  Wind driven hail and torrential rain shredded crops, broke windows and caused considerable property damage.  Agricultural losses were in the tens of millions of dollars.  This storm was likely the worst this generation had experienced, and "old-timers" had to remember back to 1937 for a comparable storm.  

The severe thunderstorm complex started early in the afternoon in the Nebraska Sand Hills and dropped south rapidly.  Widespread reports of 70 mph winds were received from western Dawson county.  A brief tornado set down 3 miles northeast of Farnam.  The tornado lifted a garage over a house and "sucked" all of the items from the walls in the house.  Golf ball size hail ripped apart crops and pasture in southwest Dawson county to the tune of 11 million dollars in loss.

The storm progressed south across Gosper county with 70 mph winds and 1 inch hail.  Power poles were broke and considerable soil erosion was reported in the county.  As the storm reached Furnas county around 6:30 pm, it intensified some and the result was extensive property damage throughout the county.  At the Southern Valley school south of Oxford, repairs of one million dollars were needed to fix the roof of the school and other structures near the school.  Water damage was reported in many parts of the school.  Windows were broken on buses and vehicles near the school grounds.  Many homes in Furnas county sustained considerable hail damage to the north side.  Windows were broken and siding damaged.  Buildings on farms throughout the county were lost.  Crop loss to the wheat, corn, and soybean crop was estimated at 15 million dollars.

Just to the east, Harlan county did not escape the wrath of the storm.  Dime size hail and 70 mph winds pummeled the Stamford and Oxford areas.  Again, property damage was widespread to homes, businesses, and outbuildings.  Crop loss in the western part of the county was nearly 7.5 million dollars.  Producers will feel the effects of the storm well into the winter with very few corn stalks in the field for cattle to feed upon nor hay to cut for winter feed.",143

Phillips and Rooks counties took the brunt of this mid-evening storm as losses in these two counties alone totaled in the millions.  

The Long Island area of northern Phillips county sustained the most damage.  Winds of 100 mph hammered the area around 7 pm and hail covered the ground like snow.  Over 300 windows in this small town were broken and nearly every home in the town sustained some damage to windows, siding or the roof.  One person was injured as she and her family tried to run for cover from the storm.  The wind blew her across the kitchen of her home and into the dining room.  She sustained head, neck and leg injuries and was transferred to a hospital in Kearney, Nebraska.  The local grain company had seven grain bins and two unloading facilities demolished.  About 1200 customers lost power during the storm.  Wind gusts to 80 mph and hail the size of quarters were also reported in Agra and Logan.

As the storm moved south into Rooks county, it spawned a brief tornado north of Webster Lake.  The funnel set down about 1 mile north of the reservoir but did little if any damage.  Just days earlier, outdoor warning devices were installed at the lake area and they were put into use to alert the public on this day.  Eighty mile an hour winds were common in Rooks county and resulted in up-rooted trees, downed power lines,  roof and building damage.  One truck was overturned on Highway 24 but the driver was uninjured.

Crop damage was limited to the remaining wheat crop and some corn.  Fortunately, about 80 percent of the wheat crop had been harvested prior to the storm.",147
