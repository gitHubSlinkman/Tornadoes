The big story was hail of an inch or more in diameter, with frequent reports of hail up to golf ball in size.  Considerable crop damage was reported with soybeans being hard hit.

As a line of thunderstorms and heavy showers moved southeast, one cell spawned a short-lived tornado in the town of Southold on the North Fork of Long Island.

The National Weather Service conducted a storm survey and confirmed the occurrence of a weak tornado in the Nassau Point area of Little Hog Neck.  This tornado was classified as an F1 with wind speeds estimated from 80 to 100 mph.

The weak tornado first touched down in the back yard of three homes on the west side of Nassau Point Road around 6:20 am EDT.  Then it moved through the front yard of one of the homes, where it did its' greatest damage.  Most of the damage was to trees.  Many trees had numerous branches twisted off and several trees were snapped off and deposited a good distance from where they grew.  Slight structural damage was done to the roof of the house.

The tornado crossed over to the east side of Nassau Point Road and apparently lifted as it moved across Hog Neck Bay.  It touched down again in Bayview (on the other side of Hog Neck Bay) around 6:40 am EDT.  Two eyewitnesses on Rambler Road experienced very strong winds, which uprooted trees and damaged several pieces of heavy lawn furniture.  In this vicinity, the tornado was classified as an F0, with an approximate path length of 0.1 miles and average path width of 10 yards.","",14
