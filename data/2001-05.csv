Thunderstorms erupted during the mid afternoon hours over the north central counties of the state.  These storms produced hail of one to one and one half inches in diameter.

The first round crossed the Northern Shenandoah Valley between 1 and 3 PM EDT and produced winds in excess of 55 MPH, dangerous lightning, hail, and a tornado.  In Shenandoah County, a home in Strasburg was struck by lightning.  Marble sized hail was reported in Tom's Brook.  Trees and power lines were downed by high wind in Orkney Springs.  In Warren County, an F1 tornado touched down around 1 mile southwest of Ashby, just south of Route 639.  The tornado moved east-northeast and crossed Route 639 just east of Ashby.  Shortly after, it crossed Route 658 just south of White Oak Level and moved into Clarke County at Milldale Road (Route 624).  Before exiting the county, the tornado struck three farms just east of Ashby.  It tore the tin roof off a barn and threw it 100 yards.  A farmhouse suffered a projectile hole and minor damage to trim and a window.  The tornado also damaged a silo, several sheds, and small outbuildings.  In addition, numerous trees were uprooted and snapped along the tornado's 4 mile long and 100 yard wide path.  The tornado remained on the ground for another mile after it crossed into Clarke County at Milldale Road (Route 624), about 3 miles southeast of Stone Bridge.  Several trees were downed on the roadway at this location.  The tornado traveled to the northeast through woodlands, then dissipated about 5 miles east of Stone Bridge.  In addition, a funnel cloud was spotted by a police officer over White Post, north of the tornadic storm.  The officer followed the storm that produced the funnel cloud from White Post to Berryville and saw the funnel drop down several times, but never touch the ground.  The only damage reported from this storm was from large amounts of golfball sized hail that accumulated up to 6 inches in depth between Double Tollgate and White Post.  The large hail damaged an asphalt roof, a flat membrane roof, and light fixtures.  It was also responsible for chipping paint off a home and stripping leaves off vegetation. In Loudoun County, a storm downed several large trees near the intersection of Algonkian Parkway and Countryside Boulevard west of Sterling in the Cascades subdivision.

The second round of storms moved through the western suburbs of Washington D.C. between 6 and 7 PM EDT and produced winds as high as 80 MPH, large hail, and heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, a strong downburst of wind estimated between 60 and 80 MPH crashed down onto the Countryside subdivision west of Sterling.  The strongest winds hit the Foxfield section near where it backs up to the Broad Run Farms subdivision.  Several townhouses had shingles peeled off their roofs and roof vents were bent upward or torn off.  About a dozen trees were uprooted and others were snapped.  Just north of this area on McPhereson Circle, several other homes had damage to siding and gutters.  Another area of damage was near the intersection of Algonkian Parkway and Countryside Boulevard.  This same area was hit by damaging wind during the first round of storms.  Several more large trees were snapped and a significant carpet of leaf debris was left on the ground and blown into fencing and against housing.  Another small area of wind damage was reported in Ashburn Farm where a tree was downed, a tent was damaged, and a window was blown in.  In addition to high winds, the eastern portion of Loudoun County was pelted by large quantities of hail.  In Countryside, hail as large as golfballs punctures the rear window of a soft topped vehicle and shredded leaves off vegetation.  The hail covered the ground up to 1 inch deep and nickel sized hail could still be found on the ground a day and a half after the storm.  Many homes in the Countryside, Cascades, and the Sugarland Run subdivisions experienced hail damage to roofs and siding.  Damage to homes in the path of the largest hailstones was estimated at $5000.  Quarter sized hail was reported in Ashburn.  Marble to quarter sized hail fell in Sterling.

In Montgomery County, a tornado touched down 3.5 miles southwest of Olney and moved northeast into the center of town.  The twister was rated an F1 and was 70 yards wide.  The first sign of damage from the tornado was downed trees at the intersection of Muncaster Mill Road and Bowie Mill Road southwest of Olney.  The tornado tracked east-northeast, passing just north of Magruder High School through North Branch Stream Valley Park.  The damage path reappeared over Norbeck Country Club.  Numerous trees were downed in a narrow area on the north end of the property and an employee saw the funnel cloud touch down.  The damage to trees continued just east of the country club into the Cahsel Manor and Williamsburg Village neighborhoods on the southwest side of Olney.  Over 40 trees were downed across the neighborhood.  A car, shed, power line, and a large fence were significantly damaged by downed trees.  One home sustained damage to a gutter and three other homes had small portions of siding pushed up or removed.  Next, the tornado moved into the center of town and crossed just east of the intersection of Route 97 and 108.  A restaurant just east of the intersection had pieces of roofing and insulation ripped off and carried blocks away.  A few trees in the parking lot were also downed.  Nearby, a strip mall which contained a multi-screen cinema and six shops sustained significant roof damage.  Pieces of roofing material were found over a mile away from the site.  Theater patrons saw ceiling tiles crashing down in the lobby.  Fifty cars in the parking lot had damage to windows and a few storefront windows were also broken.  Remarkably, no injuries were reported. The mall had to be evacuated and temporarily condemned until structural engineers could make repairs.  The tornado continued to down trees northeast of the shopping center between Appomattox Road and Brooke Grove Elementary School before dissipating.

In addition, the tornadic storm produced high winds a few miles west of Olney.  Trees were downed near the intersection of Bowie Mill Road and Bready Drive.  The same storm system dropped dime sized hail on Montgomery Village.  A storm earlier in the afternoon downed trees in Rockville.  Several other locations across the county reported pea to marble sized hail during the afternoon, including Potomac, Rockville, Silver Spring, and Burtonsville.  Late in the evening another storm produced a funnel cloud over Avenel Golf Course in Potomac.  No damage was reported.  In Howard County, pea to marble sized hail fell in Columbia.  Five miles south of town, dime to penny sized hail was reported.  High winds caused power outages across the county.  In Anne Arundel County, trees and power lines were downed in Glen Burnie, Rivera Beach, and Annapolis.  Pea to marble sized hail fell in Jessup, Rivera Beach, Glen Burnie, and at Fort Meade.  A wind gust of 45 MPH was reported in Pasadena.  In Baltimore County, trees and power lines were downed in Cockeysville, Towson, and Middle River.",179

Four houses had severe roof damage and about a dozen others suffered minor damage. A construction trailer was tossed and two vehicles were overturned. Between 150 and 200 trees were either uprooted or damaged. Tree damage was so extensive that Hawkins Road Park was closed. The area was littered with broken pieces of wood, shingles, gutters and parts of roofs. The tornado's path length was about 1.5 miles and its path width was around 200 feet. No injuries were reported. This was the first strong tornado in New Jersey since August 20, 1999 and the first strong tornado in Monmouth County since October 16, 1955.

The tornado first touched down near Arbach Lane in Manalapan Township. It initially was relatively weak (F0) on the Fujita Scale, but intensified into an F1 tornado before it reached Kentucky Court. One property on Kentucky Court lost dozens of trees. The tornado also downed trees on Ivanhoe and Rowena Roads. The tornado reached its maximum strength (F2) as it passed through Debracy Court where the worst damage occurred. Four homes suffered severe roof damage. The roof and second floor of one home had to be completely repaired. The windows of another house all burst. A restored Thunderbird was damaged by flying debris that penetrated the garage door. The house apparently shifted as doors no longer closed. A third home on the block had a picnic table blown into its sunroom along with a piece of the neighbor's fence. Patio furniture was splintered throughout the block. A minivan parked in one driveway, was rolled about 40 feet. The tornado weakened to an F1 after it left Debracy Court. Nevertheless, it tore shingles from a home on Eastwood Boulevard and downed a tree onto a car. A construction trailer on Hawkins Corner Road was blown 50 feet across the street and crushed like an aluminum can.  As the tornado crossed into Marlboro Township, it knocked down dozens of trees in Hawkins Road Park. The part was closed because of the uprooted trees. As the tornado exited the park, it weakened to an F0. It still knocked a tree onto a house on MacLeisch Drive and ripped shingles and gutters from homes on Guest and MacLeisch Drives.

The damage path then turned more easterly with numerous large oak trees, approximately 12-14 inches in diameter, ripped out of the ground immediately east of town. In addition, a well-secured playground set made of wood was blown northeastward through a chain-linked fence. Scattered power pole and tree damage then continued to 4 1/2 miles east of Ratliff City.","A very large and severe line of thunderstorms formed across southwest Kansas during the late afternoon of the 27th, and moved southward into Oklahoma during the evening. Widespread damage due to straight-line winds accompanied the line of thunderstorms, with most of southwest and south central Oklahoma sustaining damage.

Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, which supplies electricity to most of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area, indicated nearly 160,000 residents were without power during the storm, which is close to the power loss experienced during the Christmas 2000 ice storm and the May 3, 1999 tornado outbreak in central Oklahoma.

A large mesocyclone developed, and the extreme winds rotated around its northeastern quarter.  All of the debris from the damaged structures was moved to the west-northwest or west.  Straight-line and twisting microburst winds, in some areas causing F2 damage, damaged or destroyed nearly 100 mobile homes, many occupied.  Embedded within these winds, three tornadoes occurred.  One, rated F2, struck the junior-senior high school building, totally destroying nearly one half of the structure.  That tornado lifted briefly and set down again about 3/4 of a mile northwest of the school building and destroyed several mobile homes.
