Reports from the day before noted more trees were down |prior to our ground survey, but had to be cleared from roadways. |Numerous trees were reported down behind the convenience store at |that intersection.||The tornado continued towards the northeast through a large field|before reaching Jackson Park Road. Along that road there was |evidence of powerline damage, where new poles had just been |installed near a residence. Additionally, there was tree debris in|the yard, but the direction of fall could not be determined in |this area. The tornado continued northeast, passing over a |residence on Theodore Road where multiple trees were snapped, |uprooted, and twisted in multiple directions. Additionally, there |was a power pole replaced in front of the home that was confirmed |to have been snapped during the tornado. ||The tornado strengthened as it continued northeast, and moved |into communities along Hopewell Road. The most severe damage noted|occurred to homes on Hopewell Court and Bullet Street, where |there was structural damage noted to several homes. Damage |included shingle and siding damage, and a garage door bent inward.|The strongest wind noted lifted off and removed the front porch |awning of one home???s roof. The debris was blown over and behind |the home. In addition to the structural damage here, there were |several trees uprooted and snapped in various directions.

The tornado began along Chapel Hills Parkway, where minor shingle damage occurred. The tornado tracked northeastward across Ellard Road and directly over the Walker Chapel Road overpass on Interstate 65. It was at this interstate exit where the tornado began to intensify rapidly, snapping numerous power poles and causing substantial damage to a hotel. The tornado continued northeastward, crossing Highway 31, causing mostly tree damage along the highway. As the tornado moved into residential areas along Fulton Drive and Lykes Boulevard, substantial damage occurred with several homes being destroyed with at least one being swept off the foundation. There was also significant tree damage in the neighborhood. Several homes along Georgetown Lane suffered significant damage as wind breached garage doors, aiding in complete roof loss in some cases. Other damage included destroyed fences, sheds, and lofting of a hot tub. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped.||As the tornado continued toward the northeast, it paralleled Carson Road and caused substantial damage to homes along Meida Circle, Darlene Drive, and New Castle Road. Buildings in an industrial area along Carson Road were damaged, including a fleet of vehicles at Hurst Towing. The damage along New Castle Road was widespread with a few trees debarked or snapped half way down the trunk, and debris from homes thrown considerable distances. The tornado began to weaken somewhat after crossing North Pine Hill Road, but still caused minor damage to the Fultondale High School and a wooded area to the east.  As it continued eastward crossing Indian Valley Road, several trees were uprooted and a few homes received minor damage.  Along Highway 79, dozens of mobile homes were damaged by falling trees in the Rusk Mobile Home Park. The tornado then crossed Highway 75 in Center Point, where trees and power lines were downed near the Jefferson County Multi-Services Facility. The tornado began to weaken further at this point, but still produced a narrow discernable track of EF0 damage just east of Center Point Lake, where trees were uprooted and minor roof and structural damage occurred. Nearing the end of its life cycle, the tornado turned northward before dissipating near Country View Court in the Arrowhead subdivision of Center Point.","A unusually warm and humid airmass was present across Central Alabama the night of January 25th due to persistent and deep south to southwest low level flow.  Surface  dew points were in the low to mid 60s and surface-based instability reached 1000-1200 J/kg. Strong shear over a deep layer was also in place and combined with the instability, favored a risk for severe storms.||The storm that produced the tornado over Jefferson County developed over Central Mississippi. As the storm moved across Mississippi and into West Alabama, it exhibited episodes of mid level rotation, but not strong enough to produce a tornado.

Once the tornado reached the airport, it moved a 737 from its parked position, spun a CRJ plane 90 degrees and flipped a small Piper plane upside down. There was also damage to a few hangars with some small percentage of metal roofing uplifted. One hangar had large canvas doors on both sides that were shredded with the support structure for one of the canvas doors wrenched free. A bit further east on the west end of the employee lot, one hardwood tree was uprooted and fell onto two cars. A few pine trees were snapped in the immediate vicinity. This one area had damage consistent with low-end EF-1 damage. The tornado may have lifted briefly as it|tracked east-southeast across sparsely populated areas. It did snap a large branch on a tree near Crawfordville Road and Rehwinkle Drive. There were several thin pines snapped along a half mile stretch of Tram Road just west of Capital Circle SE. Many of these trees were likely weakened by Hurricane Michael. Damage was done to a few small trees along the southern periphery of the Southwood Community, along Shumard Oak Blvd. and Four Oaks Blvd. There were then sporadic instances of damage along Tram Road east of Southwood. Damage was then noted along St. Joe Rd. with several trees snapped and uprooted there. Uprooted trees and minor property damage occurred on Fox Tail Road and Bobby Godwin Lane before the tornado lifted just west the Jefferson County line.  Damage cost was estimated.

The tornado continued northeast snapping and uprooting additional trees before crossing a large pasture at the end of Cross Creek Road, where it ripped a portion of the roof of a single family home and damaged a nearby outbuilding. The tornado weakened shortly thereafter, but not before ripping the metal roofing off of a metal storage building, flipping a trampoline onto its side, and pushing the skirting inward on a mobile home at the end of Cane Road. The tornado then lifted shortly before crossing Pine Street/Highway 1 on the north side of Vivian.","A warm front lifted north across East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of February 28th, reaching Southeast Oklahoma and the northern sections of Southwest Arkansas prior to daybreak. In its wake, a warm, moist, and unstable air mass had spread north across all of the region, ahead of a longwave trough that emerged out of the Four Corners Region and into the Plains during the afternoon. Daytime heating contributed to enough instability during the late afternoon through the evening which aided in shower and thunderstorm development once large scale forcing increased ahead of the approaching trough. One isolated severe thunderstorm developed during the early evening just ahead of an attendant cold front, which produced a brief tornado on the north side of Vivian in Northern Caddo Parish. These storms weakened by mid-evening as instability waned.",79

There were several snapped trees along with roof damage at several homes, before more extensive structural damage occurred at 5250 Hwy 558.||Several large barns were destroyed or had at least 70% of their walls blown out. A brand new (1 month old) 64' x 56' barn was totally destroyed. The debris from the barn was thrown over a quarter of a mile down wind to the northeast. Another 60' x 43' barn that had recently been remodeled and upgraded had three walls blown out. A Kubota UTV weighing 2500 pounds was moved 30 yards and rotated 180 degrees. There was also extensive snapping and uprooting of trees. Winds were estimated to be 110 mph.||Farther to the northeast, a large 50' x 60' barn was destroyed, and debris went at least a half of a mile down wind. A mobile home along Hwy 829 was lifted off its foundation, and there were several trees uprooted and snapped.||The tornado crossed 829 and then crossed 1009 with extensive tree damage along both sides of the road. A large barn on 1009 had two walls blown out with debris thrown over a half of a mile downwind into Wayne county.||The tornado continued into far western portions of Wayne county.||Clinton County Emergency Management Director Lucas Abner and Dr. Bill Fountain, the Extension Specialist from the University of Kentucky Extension helped with the survey.","A stalled frontal boundary brought waves of heavy rainfall to central Kentucky from February 26 through February 28. This caused record rainfall, isolated severe winds, and even a tornado. As a result, Bowling Green set a February daily rainfall record with 5.11 on the 28th. The severe winds brought down some trees and a power pole, but the most property damage came from a brief EF1 tornado.",80

The winds|generally were from the west to southwest surrounding the tornado.|The straight line winds of 65 to 75 mph damaged 2 barns.","In the midst of a widespread heavy rainfall event, a short-lived tornado produced damage in portions of Clinton and Wayne Counties in southern Kentucky. ||Thunderstorms were embedded in the heavier rainfall throughout the day and evening. A line of storms developed across south-central Kentucky, and began to bow out as it moved eastward across Clinton County. The bow then showed signs of breaking, which results in heightened rotational potential. Damage was then reported in both Clinton and Wayne Counties by local Emergency Management. This prompted the Louisville office to conduct a storm survey. ||From this survey, it was concluded that a short-lived EF1 tornado tracked across portions of Clinton County (Louisville NWS County Warning Area) and then briefly into Wayne County, before dissipating. Debris from Clinton County was also carried over into Wayne County.",81
