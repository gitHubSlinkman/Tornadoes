Visual observation of the damage site indicated that the tornado initially touched down and caused minor damage to a bill board sign on the east side of U.S. Highway 41, north of Jayson's Mini Storage.  On the northern side of Jayson's Mini Storage, the tornado continued it's descent and briefly touched down where it lifted, tossed and demolished, a weathered travel trailer, approximately 40 yards to the south southwest from its original location.  Two additional nearby weathered travel trailers were flipped over on their sides while a badly weathered storage trailer was severely damaged on it's north and west facing sides by the tornadic wind at the storage facility.

The tornado then lifted and dissipated within a tenth of a mile from the initial touchdown point.  However, small pieces of debris from the travel trailers, carried by the tornadic winds, were observed in a tall tree approximately 500 yards south southwest of the touchdown site.

The tornado path width was estimated at ten yards at its widest point while its path length was estimated at less than a tenth of a mile.  No human fatalities or injuries were reported.  However, one animal, a dog that was housed near the site of the touchdown, was killed.

Based on analysis of radar and satellite imagery at the time of the event, the tornado possibly formed as the result of sea breeze and multiple outflow boundary interaction from nearby shower and thunderstorm activity.","",5

A mesoscale vorticity maximum developed over the High Plains during the previous night and was located over northeast Nebraska during the morning of the 24th.  A complex of thunderstorms continued to move east into northwest Iowa.  As daytime heating continued, the storms became stronger and more organized.  The main product into the early afternoon hours was heavy rainfall.  During the early to mid afternoon hours, meso analysis clearly indicated the development of a surface low pressure system.  As the outflow, or meso cold front, dropped southeast into southern Iowa it encountered very rich air with dew points in the low 80s.  Thunderstorms developed explosively in central Iowa.  Within 15 to 20 minutes of initial development the storms became severe.  A tornado touched down in an open field in southern Polk County, about 5 miles south of West Des Moines.  The tornado was not well organized and did little damage.  Most of the storms that became severe produced high winds.  Winds of 65 MPH were reported in the Waterloo area.  One cell produced a wet microburst southeast of the city of Waterloo with winds around 80 MPH.  The high winds ripped the roof off of a house there, resulting in the house being toppled.  The storms left 2.29 inches of rain officially in the city, though some areas unofficially reported in excess of 8 inches.  Considerable urban flooding took place in the city of Waterloo, with flash flooding in the outlying areas.  Many basements were flooded as reports of standing water nearly 3 feet deep in the streets were received.  Earlier in the afternoon heavy rains fell in Webster City.  Upwards of 2 inches of rain fell in under an hour causing urban flooding in the city.  The water receded quickly after the rain stopped.  High winds were also reported in Story County in the Ames area.  A few reports of hail were received, but the hail was not all that large being as the freezing level was 15000 feet.  Nickle size hail fell in Waterloo and also in Windsor Heights.  After the initial fury of activity, the storms did not produce severe weather for a few hours.  As the storms continued to move east, they picked up in intensity again in the Ottumwa area.  Winds of 60 to 70 MPH blew through Ottumwa and continued east toward the Agency area.",103
