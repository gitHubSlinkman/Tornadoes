The tornado outbreak on the 1st of November was a rare and unusual weather phenomena to occur so late in the year in North
Dakota. The last recorded tornado to occur in the state was October 11th 1979 in Sargent county in southeastern North Dakota.
Several tornadoes, with five distinct paths, hit south central North Dakota causing property damage and injuries. The majority
of the damage and injuries occurred in the Bismarck area. Forty two homes sustained minor to major damage. The tornadoes
were rated F0 and F1 on the Fujita scale, packing winds up to 90 mph. Another unusual phenomena observed were that these
tornadoes traveled from east to west. This was caused by an intense low pressure system , centered over north central South
Dakota, spinning counterclockwise, allowing the low level flow over Bismarck to move east to west. At the same time period
these tornadoes were occurring, snow began to fall in the far western area of North Dakota. Winter storm watches and warnings
were posted across north central and western North Dakota that afternoon.",8
