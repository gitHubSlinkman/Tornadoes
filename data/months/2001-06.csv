The dynamics were sufficient to overcome the shortcomings in moisture available for the system.  A cold front dropped southeast out of the Dakotas into Iowa during the afternoon.  Surface dew points were generally in the mid 50s ahead of the front, though a narrow ribbon of upper 50s to lower 60s was found just ahead of the front.  As the cold front dropped southeast, a very strong closed low at 500 mb was also dropping into the area.  This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.  One of the storms became very intense over Butler County during the early afternoon.  Softball size hail was reported with this cell, causing significant damage south of the town of Allison.  The storms over southwest Iowa underwent a transition into more of a wind event.  High winds were reported in Cass County as the storms moved through the Griswold area.  By mid afternoon, the storms in southern Iowa had taken on a bow configuration.  As the storms moved through Adair County, very strong winds swept through the northeast part of the county.   The winds toppled power lines northeast of Greenfield.  As the storms continued east, the intensity decreased.  The storms still produced gusty winds, but speeds were generally in the 45 to 55 MPH range.",2

This helped to destabilize the atmosphere as freezing levels fell to the 8000 to 10,000 foot range by evening.  A small area of thunderstorms developed by mid day over north central Iowa.  The storms intensified rapidly during the maximum heating of the day.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the original area and became severe quickly.  For the most part the storms produced hail and small tornadoes.  The first tornado touched in Crawford County.  The county Emergency Manager reported seeing 7 funnel clouds and two brief touchdowns with the initial cell.  The tornadoes were all small and were only on the ground briefly.  Several other brief touchdowns occurred in the County before the storm moved east.  The strongest tornado touched down on the edge of the town of Denison.  A 14 x 50 metal building was destroyed.  A fire hydrant was damaged in the vicinity by flying debris.  It was reported that water could be seen being sucked out of the hydrant by the tornado.  The tornado threat shifted into northeast Iowa for the rest of the afternoon.  Several tornadoes touched down in Bremer, Butler, and Black Hawk Counties.  Most of these were quite small and did little damage however.  The longest track tornado touched down in the Janesville area of Bremer County and tracked over 8 miles to the east, lifting just east of the town of Denver.  The countryside is quite open between these two locations.  For this reason, damage was minimal as the tornado actually missed both of the towns.  With the cold air aloft, hail was a significant factor.  There were reports of at least half inch diameter hail with nearly all of the storms.  Numerous reports of hail of an inch up to golf ball size were received.  The storms produced three inch diameter hail on the north side of Belmond, causing significant damage to the area and reportedly covering the ground.  One of the storms became very intense over Butler County during the early afternoon.  Softball size hail was reported with this cell, causing significant damage south of the town of Allison.  The storms over southwest Iowa underwent a transition into more of a wind event.  High winds were reported in Cass County as the storms moved through the Griswold area.  By mid afternoon, the storms in southern Iowa had taken on a bow configuration.  As the storms moved through Adair County, very strong winds swept through the northeast part of the county.   The winds toppled power lines northeast of Greenfield.  As the storms continued east, the intensity decreased.  The storms still produced gusty winds, but speeds were generally in the 45 to 55 MPH range.",14

A vigorous upper level storm system and strong mid level jet moved through the Mid Mississippi Valley during the afternoon and evening.  The associated surface cold front moved into East Central Iowa during peak heating.  Mid level cooling and strong surface heating created a moderately unstable airmass.  Speed and directional shear was also more than sufficient to spawn supercell thunderstorms near Waterloo, which moved east into Buchanan County producing several tornadoes.  Eventually, the activity evolved into a squall line which moved across much of the remainder of Eastern Iowa, Northwest and West Central Illinois and Northeast Missouri.  However, decreasing instability, coupled with the loss of daytime heating resulted in a gradual weakening of the storms and only a few severe reports. 

Here is a summary of the tornadoes which struck Buchanan and Delaware Counties:

Buchanan County - 455 pm CDT
An F1 tornado touched down 2.5 miles north to northwest of Winthrop and lifted at 505 pm CDT approximately 2.25 miles north of Winthrop.  This tornado was on the ground for about 1 mile and was 150 yards wide.  This tornado produced the most severe damage from the entire event as it ripped through the Tempus farm site at 1846 Reed Avenue.  The Tempus home suffered minor damage with a few windows blown out and pieces of siding removed.  Several large outbuildings were totally destroyed, including a large machine shed, barn and an open faced cattle shed.  Seven head of cattle were killed with 15 to 20 head of cattle injured.  A large combine and several other pieces of farm equipment were damaged.  

Buchanan County -  501 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down 1 mile south of Fairbank near Baxter Avenue and 120th Street.  This tornado produced no damage.  A National Weather Service Cooperative Observer reported seeing this tornado as a white thin cloud touching the ground, but not appearing to connect with the cloud base.  Hail also covered the ground about 4.7 miles south of Highway 281 on W13 and Amish Boulevard. 

Buchanan County - 506 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down one half mile southwest of Independence, just north of Highway 20 and west of Illinois Avenue.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage. 

Buchanan County - 506 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down 1 mile west of Independence and lifted on the east end of town at approximately 516 pm.  This tornado was on the ground for 3 miles and was 150 yards wide.  This tornado produced mainly tree damage.  A farm on the west side of Independence suffered minor damage to a grain elevator.  Several homes in Independence also suffered minor damage, mainly to shingles and siding.  Eyewitness reports indicated that a much broader rotation was associated with this tornado several hundred feet above the ground with possible multiple vortices. 

Buchanan County - 511 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down 2 miles southwest of Lamont near Taylor Avenue and 150th Street.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage reported.  Trained spotters observed this tornado as two smaller vortices, which merged together before lifting a short time later. 

Delaware County - 512 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down 2 miles northwest of Manchester.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage reported. 

Buchanan County - 529 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down 3.5 miles southeast of Winthrop near County Road W45 and 260th Street.  A hog confinement sustained minor damage and one older corn crib suffered damage.  Evidence of this tornado was visible in a field approaching the damage site as old corn stock debris was swept into a nearby fence. 

Buchanan County - 534 pm CDT
An F0 tornado touched down 5.75 miles southeast of Winthrop near York Avenue and 280th Street.  This was a brief touchdown with no damage reported.",16

A vigorous upper level storm system and strong mid level jet moved through the Mid Mississippi Valley during the afternoon and evening.  The associated surface cold front moved into East Central Iowa during peak heating.  Mid level cooling and strong surface heating created a moderately unstable airmass.  Speed and directional shear was also more than sufficient to spawn supercell thunderstorms near Waterloo, which moved east into Buchanan County producing several tornadoes.  Eventually, the activity evolved into a squall line which moved across much of the remainder of Eastern Iowa, Northwest and West Central Illinois and Northeast Missouri.  However, decreasing instability, coupled with the loss of daytime heating resulted in a gradual weakening of the storms and only a few severe reports. 

Here is a summary of the tornadoes which struck Buchanan and Delaware Counties:

Fond du Lac County:  a boat in the Fond du Lac harbor sustained wind damage.
Sheboygan County:  Hurricane-force winds over-turned a barn four (4) miles north of Beechwood.
Dodge County:  A F1 tornado traveled from a point 4 miles north of Fox Lake to 4 miles east of Fox Lake.  A tornado spun up near Rubicon and then moved southeast into Washington County just north of State Highway 60.  Along its path in Dodge County, only F0 damage was observed.  Elsewhere, in the village of Neosho, a residential home was damaged by felled trees. In a rural area near Hustisford, the roof of a home was partially ripped off and several farm outbuildings were damaged.
Washington County:  The tornado that spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) intensified to a F1 rating as it moved southeast through the southwest part of Hartford, before dissipating southeast of the city.  This tornado inflicted wind or tree damage to more than 250 residential homes and business. 
Waukesha County: Down-burst winds pushed over a barn near the village of Lannon.  Most of the tree and power-line damage was noted in the Oconomowoc to Waukesha area, and in the North Prairie to Eagle area.
Milwaukee County: tree/power-line damage across much of county.  Several cars sustained damaged from felled trees.  Mitchell Field had a measured maximum wind gust of 60 knots (69 mph).  Lightning struck a Wauwatosa home, resulting in a roof/attic fire.

As the squall line moved through south-central and southeast Wisconsin, heavy rains reduced visibilities to 100-200 feet at some locations.  Total rainfall for the event was impressive, and exceeded 2 inches in some spots. West Allis (Milwaukee Co.) registered 2.70 inches, Watertown (Jefferson Co.) and Janesville (Rock Co.) measured 2.64 inches, Madison's Truax Field came in with 1.94 inches, and Milwaukee Mitchell Field recorded 1.75 inches.

It traveled southeast and intensified to a F1 rating (winds about 78 to 87 knots, or 90 to 100 mph) as it cut across the southwest part of Hartford.  This tornado inflicted minor damage on 250 homes, major damage to 5 homes, and minor damage to 3 businesses.  Additional tornado-related costs, such as debris removal, protective measures, etc, amounted to $102,100.","A powerful squall line plowed through most of south-central and southeast Wisconsin during the late evening hours of June 11, 2001, resulting in widespread damage to trees, power lines, and power poles.   There were many reports of damage to residential homes, businesses, and motor vehicles, caused by falling trees/branches. Maximum wind gusts were in the 64 to 78 knot range (74 to 90 mph) in parts of Sheboygan, Dodge, and Washington counties, and 50 to 63 knots (58 to 73 mph) elsewhere.  In addition, three (3) tornadoes formed in a meso low-pressure on the left side of a pronounced down-burst located on the leading edge of the squall line.  One of the tornadoes, rated F0, briefly affected the area southwest of the village of Marquette (Green Lake Co.).  Later on, the same meso-low-pressure/down-burst couplet generated a F1 tornado that affected the area north and east of Fox Lake (Dodge Co.).  The last tornado (F1) spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) and moved southeast into Washington County, giving the city of Waterford a glancing blow.  Refer to individual narratives on these 3 tornadoes under the tornado events for June 11th. Significant county reports follow.

Marquette County:  A tree fell on and damaged a home in Packwaukee. Near Westfield, ten (10) calf pens were destroyed.
Green Lake County:  A brief tornado (F0) damaged a home, barn, and several trees about 3 miles southwest of Marquette.  In addition, near Dalton, two (2) barns were severely damaged by down-burst winds.
Fond du Lac County:  a boat in the Fond du Lac harbor sustained wind damage.
Sheboygan County:  Hurricane-force winds over-turned a barn four (4) miles north of Beechwood.
Dodge County:  A F1 tornado traveled from a point 4 miles north of Fox Lake to 4 miles east of Fox Lake.  A tornado spun up near Rubicon and then moved southeast into Washington County just north of State Highway 60.  Along its path in Dodge County, only F0 damage was observed.  Elsewhere, in the village of Neosho, a residential home was damaged by felled trees. In a rural area near Hustisford, the roof of a home was partially ripped off and several farm outbuildings were damaged.
Washington County:  The tornado that spun up near Rubicon (Dodge Co.) intensified to a F1 rating as it moved southeast through the southwest part of Hartford, before dissipating southeast of the city.  This tornado inflicted wind or tree damage to more than 250 residential homes and business. 
Waukesha County: Down-burst winds pushed over a barn near the village of Lannon.  Most of the tree and power-line damage was noted in the Oconomowoc to Waukesha area, and in the North Prairie to Eagle area.
Milwaukee County: tree/power-line damage across much of county.  Several cars sustained damaged from felled trees.  Mitchell Field had a measured maximum wind gust of 60 knots (69 mph).  Lightning struck a Wauwatosa home, resulting in a roof/attic fire.

As the squall line moved through south-central and southeast Wisconsin, heavy rains reduced visibilities to 100-200 feet at some locations.  Total rainfall for the event was impressive, and exceeded 2 inches in some spots. West Allis (Milwaukee Co.) registered 2.70 inches, Watertown (Jefferson Co.) and Janesville (Rock Co.) measured 2.64 inches, Madison's Truax Field came in with 1.94 inches, and Milwaukee Mitchell Field recorded 1.75 inches. Most small streams reached near-bankfull stages, and the Fox River at New Munster, in western Kenosha County, eventually exceeded its 10 foot flood stage by 2.25 feet early at 0000CST on June 14, 2001.

The squall line was the tail extension of an intense bow-echo that struck the east-central Wisconsin counties of Waushara, Winnebago, Calumet, and Manitowoc with hurricane-force, down-burst winds.  Twenty-four hours earlier, the bow-echo/squall line was a cluster of thunderstorms over eastern Montana.  Synpotically, a warm front extended from central Minnesota to southwest Wisconsin to just south of Chicago.   Aloft, a 500mb short-wave trough moved east across North Dakota and then moved southeast across Minnesota and Wisconsin.

This outflow boundary became established east to west across central Iowa.  At the same time a complex of thunderstorms that was generated by a short wave moving across Nebraska advanced toward western Iowa just before sunrise.  Though upper level jet divergence was in place, a strong mid level cap was in place through most of the night and the outflow boundary never produced any thunderstorm activity.  Temperatures in the mid levels fall significantly around sunrise.  The outflow boundary "lit up like a Christmas tree" around sunrise.  The thunderstorms became severe quickly and were large hail producers.  The storms moved east along the east to west line and also produced copious amounts of rainfall.  Initially the threat was the large hail.  Numerous reports of one to two inch diameter hail were received through central Iowa.  Some of the greatest damage occurred in the Des Moines metropolitan area as golf ball size hail pelted the city.  Damage was significant to both roofs as well as cars.  Several large car dealerships were hit on the west side of town with significant damage reported.  Estimates of damage were in the area of $250,000 to $500,000 each.  One off duty NWS employee on the west side has his back window broken out by hail with numerous hail pocks in the car. Initial estimates of damage on the west side of town indicate about 5000 insurance claims for cars at $900 to $1500 each, plus 3000 insurance claims for damages house roofs.  Golf ball size hail and 4 inches of rain fell near Grinnell in Poweshiek County.  Hail drifted to a depth of 2 to 3 feet deep in places.  Crops were totally destroyed as the hail fell for 25 minutes.  One farmer in the area reported 1000 acres of crops destroyed.  Wind was not a major factor with most of these storms.  One high wind report was received in Jasper County south of Prairie City.  Several trees were blown down there.  In addition, one tornado touched down briefly in the county.  The touchdown was in open country west of the town of Montezuma.  The tornado did little damage and lifted in a very short time.  Focus then shifted to the heavy rainfall.  The storms trained along the east west line for several hours.  A band of very heavy rain was reported from Greene County, east into Boone, Story, Dallas, and Polk Counties.  Rainfall of three to four inches was common in these areas.  Numerous roads were closed due to the high water. Water was standing in fields everywhere.  Some of the worst damage occurred in Story County as the densely populated area of Ames and Iowa State University was affected.  By the mid afternoon hours, the thunderstorms weakened and began to lift north slowly.  During the early afternoon hours as the thunderstorms moved through Sac County, lightning struck a tree in the town of Schaller.  The tree was split and landed on the house causing several thousand dollars damage.",121

Summary of 6/14/01 event:  (For additional details, see individual entries for the date)

A thunderstorm complex developed over north central Missouri and south central Iowa during the early afternoon hours.  The complex quickly evolved into a squall line/bow echo that swept over much of the NWS Quad Cities County Warning Area, which includes eastern Iowa, northwest and west central Illinois, and far northeast Missouri.  Numerous funnel clouds and two confirmed tornadoes developed along the leading edge of the line.  Three people suffered minor injuries during one of the tornadoes, and two people were injured when straight line winds blew their semi-trailer trucks over.  There were no fatalities. There was widespread straight-line wind damage, along with isolated downbursts and large hail.  Wind gusts up to 80 mph were reported.",204

A ground and aerial survey later revealed that a tornado moved through Princeton, and two microbursts occurred in Leominster and Shirley.

The tornado occurred between 1141 am and 1143 am in the Coalkiln Road area, in the southeast portion of the town of Princeton.  It was rated as an F1 tornado, with winds between 73 and 112 mph.  The path length was three-quarters of a mile and the width was as much as 1700 feet.  A hundred or more trees were either uprooted or snapped off.  A small camper was severely damaged after being lifted up and dropped on a fallen tree.  Another tree fell on a house.  No injuries occurred.  Eyewitnesses, including a trained Skywarn spotter, observed hail as large as ping pong balls just before the tornado struck.  There were no visual sightings of a funnel cloud or tornado, which was likely obscured by heavy rain.  This was the first tornado to strike Worcester County since August 10, 1990.

A microburst occurred in the eastern portion of  Leominster near Johnny Appleseed Lane, just west of Interstate 190.  Damage was seen in an area roughly one-half by one-third of a mile, as evidenced by the pattern of fallen and uprooted trees.  Another microburst occurred in Shirley, near the east shore of Lake Shirley to Center Road and Parker Road.  A truck was damaged by a fallen tree, while other trees fell on a car and a mobile home.  Two chimneys were also toppled.  

Torrential rainfall caused street and poor drainage flooding throughout central and eastern Massachusetts, and snarled traffic on Father's Day.  Storm totals of 3 to 5 inches were common throughout most of the region.  Lightning struck two homes in Middlesex County and caused significant damage.  One in Marlborough hit a nearby tree, and traveled into the house through a stone wall, destroying the bathroom.

The storms began in Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden Counties around mid afternoon, and downed trees in Turners Falls, Worthington, and Chester.  Dime to nickel sized hail was also reported.  Severe weather reports became more numerous by late afternoon as the storms reached central and northeast Massachusetts.  There many reports of large trees down from Littleton, Wilmington, Southborough, Shrewsbury and Sterling, where a spotter recorded a gust to 62 mph.   In Essex County, severe thunderstorms downed trees and dropped dime sized hail in Lynnfield, Peabody, Beverly, and Marblehead. 

More severe thunderstorms erupted in Worcester County during the evening, dropping quarter sized hail in Mendon.  These storms tracked into southern Middlesex County near Holliston, where large limbs were downed, then reached Norfolk County where more considerable storm damage occurred.  A microburst downed many large trees and wires in Bellingham, Millis, and Medway.  A survey of the debris and an eyewitness account also confirmed that a small F0 tornado touched down in Bellingham around 725 pm EDT.  The tornado was estimated to have a path length of 150 yards and a width of 80 yards.  Wind speeds were estimated near 70 mph.  There were no injuries.  Spotters reported hail as large as a half dollar prior to the wind damage.  As the storms progressed across Norfolk County, trees and power lines were downed in Sharon, Walpole, and Norwood.  Another severe thunderstorm later in the evening downed trees onto a road in Walpole and another on a house.

The storms also contained frequent cloud-to-ground lightning.  Tens of thousands were left without power.  In Auburn, lightning caused two house fires when a nearby transformer was struck.  In Whitman, a house fire started by a lightning strike on the second floor.  Police and fire communications were temporarily disrupted when lightning struck an antenna in Norwood.",257
