The strongest storm, a supercell, passed through Calvert County and spawned an F1 tornado about 1 mile southeast of Dunkirk.  The tornado had a width of 75 yards, traveled on the ground for 1 1/2 miles and was responsible for over $200,000 worth of damage.  The first building struck by the twister around 3:40 PM EDT was a private school under construction on Mt. Harmony Road about 1/2 mile east of Route 4. The tornado damaged 3 sections of an 8 to 10 ton reinforced brick wall and removed a 30 foot section of roof. Two windows on cars in a nearby parking lot were blown out.  An old wooden barn about 600 yards from the school was also destroyed. The tornado moved east-northeast for about a mile, damaging trees and causing minor home damage along its path as it crossed through Cattertons Reach and Megatha Lane.  The tornado dissipated near the intersection of Chesapeake Road West and Route 2 (Solomons Island Road) at 3:45 PM EDT.  In addition to the tornado damage, a barn filled with farm equipment across from Mt. Harmony Elementary School near Dunkirk was destroyed by downburst winds.  Also, Mid Bay buoy east of St. Leonard recorded a wind gust near 90 knots around 4:00 PM EDT as the same storm moved across the Chesapeake Bay.  

Before the supercell became tornadic near Dunkirk, it passed through northern Charles County.  Winds in excess of 55 MPH produced over $50,000 worth of damage. At the intersection of Bensville Road and Courtney Drive west of Waldorf, straight line winds destroyed a two story home under construction around 3:05 PM. Quarter sized hail was reported and ten trees within one half mile of the home were also damaged. Quarter sized hail also fell in White Plains and Waldorf.  A resident of St. Charles reported a funnel cloud at the intersection of St. Charles Parkway and Smallwood Drive at 3:07 PM EDT. 

Additional thunderstorms moved across Central Maryland between 2 and 7 PM EDT.  In Prince George's County, a postal worker in Clinton was injured around 3:15 PM EDT when lightning struck near her.

In Montgomery County, quarter sized hail fell in Germantown, Rockville, and Wheaton.  Dime sized hail fell in Layhill and Colesville, and half dollar sized hail fell in Gaithersburg.  The volume of hail resulted in accumulations of 3 to 4 inches on lawns and roadways, with drifts up to 10 inches against buildings and fences.  Trees were stripped of leaves, small dents were found on cars, and one neighborhood in Gaithersburg reported chipped paint on homes.  In Howard County, golf ball sized hail fell in Columbia.  In Baltimore County, pea sized hail was reported in Brookland at 5:43 PM EDT.  In Washington County, quarter sized hail fell on the north side of Hagerstown and minor stream flooding was reported after heavy downpours in Hancock. 

Heavy rain and strong east winds over the Chesapeake Bay also led to tidal flooding in Annapolis Harbor on the morning of the 21st.  Several roads near the City Dock area were flooded with up to 2 feet of water around high tide.  Water poured over the seawall forcing police to barricade Dock Street and to close Compromise Street.
