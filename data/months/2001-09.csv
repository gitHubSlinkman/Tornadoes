A strong short wave trough in the upper level atmosphere, moved northeast through Iowa and Wisconsin during the afternoon and evening hours.  This wave of energy  helped thunderstorms, which were moving along a warm front in northeast Iowa, become strong.  Despite the lack of convective available potential energy, ample moisture and wind shear along the front allowed thunderstorms within this area of rain to rotate and produce a few short lived tornadoes.  One storm in Buchanan County Iowa, produced two tornadoes as it quickly moved northeast along the warm front.

Here is a summary of the tornadoes which struck northeastern Buchanan County Iowa.

At 605 pm CDT, an F0 tornado touched down 5 miles southwest of Aurora, Iowa, producing damage to the Ralph Kramer farm site.  Several out buildings were damaged or destroyed. One empty grain bin was moved off of its foundation.  The home only had minor damage, with some siding blown off.  The tornado continued moving northeast, producing crop and tree damage as it crossed 142 street.  At 625 pm, the tornado struck the Lonnie McAllister farm site, again damaging or destroying farm out buildings.  This is also where the most significant crop damage was observed.  The tornado then lifted, leaving a trail of some tin and other debris, as the storm moved northeast.  This tornado was on the ground for 3.5 miles and was 40 yards wide at its widest point.

At 630 pm CDT, an F2 tornado touched down 0.25 miles southwest of Aurora and quickly moved across Aurora, producing damage to the roof of the American Legion building in Aurora.  The tornado then struck the Ken Mosher home just east of Aurora.  The tornado totally ripped off the roof and two car garage of this newer frame dwelling.

A F1 tornado with a path length of 8.5 miles, which was 300 yards wide, produced maximum wind speeds of 110 m.p.h. that caused extensive damage. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. The tornado touched down on Windsor Highway in Eaton county three quarters of a mile west of I-69. The tornado began as a F0 about 150 feet wide. The tornado moved northeast at about 40 m.p.h. and caused a considerable amount of tree damage, major damage to barns and outbuildings, and minor damage to homes. It crossed I-69 just south of Davis Highway, blowing over a semi trailer causing minor injuries. It began to strengthen and widen as it crossed Davis Highway, and numerous trees were blown down and barns destroyed. As it crossed I-96 it continued to strengthen and it destroyed a large metal building that housed a used parts store on Canal road. It lifted a double wide mobile home off its foundation, but did not cause major damage because the mobile home was securely tied down at all supports. Several trees were blown down in the area. 

The tornado continued northeast on Canal road and destroyed a large cooling tower at the Erickson power plant, at which time the tornado's peak intensity of F1 with 110 m.p.h. winds was attained. It was estimated that more than 4 million dollars in damage was incurred to the Lansing Board of Water and Light's Erickson power plant. The tornado continued to move northeast, gradually weakening and becoming wider. It caused damage to semi trailers and trees along Creyts road, and to the roof of the Meijer warehouse. It proceeded across Mt. Hope highway and crossed I-496 near Snow road. It knocked down a large tree and sent branches of the tree flying through the air like missiles, which broke windows out of numerous cars in a church parking lot. The tornado continued to weaken as it moved through residential areas just north of I-96, causing mainly tree damage. The last damage occurred on a golf course just east of Waverly road in Ingham county, where a tree was blown down. 

An isolated severe thunderstorm earlier in the day blew down several large limbs in Oakfield township (Kent county). In Harrison (Clare county), trained spotters reported that a large tree was blown down by a thunderstorm wind gusts.

Two people were injured when the tornado damaged a trailer park.","Five tornadoes touched down in Northern Virginia during the afternoon and early evening of the 24th.  The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come "off the mountain" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  

Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado "dropped onto it".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  

The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  

Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.

The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  

In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows. In Rappahannock County, 3.75 inches was reported in Castleton.",83

The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  

The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  

Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.

The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  

In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows.

Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado "dropped onto it".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.

It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado "dropped onto it".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  

The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  

Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.

The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  

In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows. In Rappahannock County, 3.75 inches was reported in Castleton.",88

At least 7 trees were downed and 1000 residents lost power.","A rope-like tornado crossed the 14th Street bridge from Arlington into the District early in the evening on the 24th.  The F0 tornado skipped along for 2 miles from the bridge to just northeast of the Capitol before it dissipated.  The weather observer at Ronald Reagan National Airport watched the tornado weaken into its rope stage as it crossed the bridge.  The observer also noted another funnel cloud coming down next to the the weakening tornado.  He watched as the tornado passed the Jefferson Monument and tracked over the Washington Monument before losing track of it.  Along the river and the Tidal Basin, a few trees were downed.  Small branches were downed across Independence Avenue about 1/2 mile east of the Lincoln Memorial.  The tornado tracked by the Smithsonian museums, along the Mall, and toward the Capitol.  An eyewitness saw swirling tree branches and leaves at the intersection of 7th Street and the Mall from his office window on D Street NW.  A staffer at the Senate Office Building across the street from the north side of the Capitol spotted the tornado picking up leaves and trash as it went by.  Another eyewitness saw a "funnel cloud" pass directly over Union Station.  The last known damage from the twister was a downed tree on Randolph Place, near the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue and New York Avenue.  The tornado which was observed to be "more horizontal than vertical" finally dissipated near this location.  However, the second funnel cloud continued to hang from the storm as it tracked northeast by McMillian Reservoir and Children's Hospital.  The fire department near Children's Hospital noted high wind and trees bending when the funnel cloud went by, but no damage was found.  This funnel cloud touched down a few minutes later as a deadly F3 tornado in the suburb of College Park, Maryland.",92

The tornado killed 2 students at the University of Maryland, injured 54 others countywide, and caused 100 million dollars in damage.","Severe thunderstorms moved through Central Maryland during the early evening of the 24th.  One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  

Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.  At least 200 vehicles in the parking lot were damaged, including at least 100 that were blown into and onto other vehicles.  At least twenty cars were totaled and one car was partially ripped apart.  The woods behind the parking lot were nearly flattened.  The bubble roof of the football practice facility near Byrd Stadium was removed.  Forty-eight people on campus, including 25 students, were injured by flying debris as the twister downed trees and ripped pieces of siding and roofing off buildings.  In addition, residential areas near the campus, including the University Courtyard Apartments sustained damage.  A total of 3000 students were left temporarily homeless after two dorms and an off-campus housing unit were evacuated due to storm damage.  During the recovery effort, a 78-year-old firefighter who responded to the tragedy at the University died of a heart attack shortly after returning from the scene. 

The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.  Several businesses along Route 1 sustained minor damage, and three additional buildings lost portions of their roofs.  Three employees of a business in the Chestnut Hills Shopping Center were injured by flying glass after the windows on the front of the store were shattered.

Thirty greenhouses were damaged and several long term studies inside were destroyed.  Fifteen other buildings west of Route 1 suffered minor to moderate damage.  Numerous trees, including a row of historic willow oaks, were downed.  Over 65 vehicles in the employee parking lot were damaged by flying debris.  Eleven of these vehicles were totaled.  Just north of the research center, "stunning" tree and power line damage was reported at the intersection of Sellman and Montgomery Roads.  The tornado tracked across Powder Mill Road and ripped the roof off an office building at the intersection of Cedar Lane.  It continued across the Beltsville Heights development and caused damage to the roof at Martin Luther King Elementary School.  

The tornado continued moving north-northeast toward Laurel.  The continuation of the damage path was located at the Virginia Manor Industrial Park on Van Dusen Road where several trees were downed.  The tornado was spotted as it moved past Laurel Hospital and it caused minor damage in the Village at Wellington subdivision nearby.  The next concentrated area of damage was found at Laurel High School.  An annex with 6 classrooms was heavily damaged.  The roof was ripped off three of the classrooms and three people inside the structure were injured by flying debris.  Significant damage was also reported to the athletic fields behind the school. The tornado moved northeast across the Fairlawn development where it damaged several homes.  One home on 10th Street was destroyed after the twister removed the roof and an outside wall.  On Montrose Avenue, a woman and her dog were briefly picked up by the tornado.  The woman sustained injuries to her hip and leg after being tossed 3 feet in the air and the dog landed uninjured.  The historic Harrison Building at the corner of 9th and Montgomery Streets lost its roof and a church and school nearby were damaged.  The tornado remained on the ground as it crossed the Patuxent River into Howard County.  Across Prince George's County, the tornado was responsible for $100 million in damage.  A total of 861 homes, 561 vehicles, and 23 businesses were damaged countywide.  

In North Laurel, the twister heavily damaged a townhouse complex on Riverbrink Court in the Settlers Landing development.  A total of 43 townhomes were damaged, four of which were uninhabitable.  The tornado weakened to an F1 before it downed trees onto All Saints Road.  The tornado weakened to an F0 as it exited North Laurel and moved across Savage Park.  Isolated reports of downed trees were received in the community, including on Red Jacket Way, Vollmerhausen Road, and at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Route 32.  In its final stages, the tornado crossed the General Electric Appliance Park and downed its final tree at the intersection of Snowden River Parkway and Route 175 southeast of Columbia.

In addition to the devastating tornado, the storms also produced very heavy rainfall and gusty winds.  In Anne Arundel County, strong winds from the tornadic thunderstorm downed 13 trees between Laurel and Maryland City.  In northern Carroll County, a bow echo produced damaging winds which downed trees along Bankard Road northwest of Union Mills.  Rainfall totals included 3.93 inches in Millers, 3.30 inches in Manchester, and 3.26 inches in Westminster.  In Montgomery County, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall across the western portion of the county caused low lying areas to quickly fill with water.  Several roads were flooded including River Road and Falls Road.  A motorist had to be rescued after their car stalled in high water in Poolsville.  A total of 3.61 inches of rainfall was recorded in Damascus.  In Howard County, between 2 and 3.75 inches of rain fell. A total of 2.86 inches was recorded in Columbia and 3.46 inches fell just southeast of the city.  In Frederick County, several roads were flooded by heavy downpours including Ball Road off Route 355 and New Design Road south of Adamstown Road.  Heavy rain downed trees at the intersection of Greenfield and Page Roads, Lingamore road and Gashouse Pike, Lawson Road and Route 75, and Bittle Road and Route 17.  Street flooding was also reported in Point of Rocks on Route 28. Rainfall totals included 2.54 inches in Wolfsville and 2.30 inches in Frederick.",93
